% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

 In this work, we showed how the receptive field affects the loss landscape of neural networks along with its representations and its behaviour on the input image.
It is important to note that there are other ways to manipulate the receptive field such as changing the kernel size of the
convolutional networks,stride, and dilation of the convolutional networks. In this work, used the minimum
intervention that would not modify the number of weights of the models as we manipulated the receptive field of the
models. Additionally, as we changed the receptive field of the models we changed the  size of internal representations,
which can greatly affect the behaviour of the models. Future work will concentrate on testing other ways to manipulate
the receptive field, such as dilation of the maxpooling layer, in addition to using padding to maintain constant the
size
of internal representations across receptive fields to test the robustness of the findings in this work.
