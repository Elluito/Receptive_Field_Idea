  abstract = {Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) are input perturbations that can fool a neural network on large sets of data. They are a class of attacks that represents a significant threat as they facilitate realistic, practical, and low-cost attacks on neural networks. In this work, we derive upper bounds for the effectiveness of UAPs based on norms of data-dependent Jacobians. We empirically verify that Jacobian regularization greatly increases model robustness to UAPs by up to four times whilst maintaining clean performance. Our theoretical analysis also allows us to formulate a metric for the strength of shared adversarial perturbations between pairs of inputs. We apply this metric to benchmark datasets and show that it is highly correlated with the actual observed robustness. This suggests that realistic and practical universal attacks can be reliably mitigated without sacrificing clean accuracy, which shows promise for the robustness of machine learning systems.},

  abstract = {Adversarial images are specifically designed to fool neural networks into making a wrong decision about what they are looking at, which severely degrade neural network accuracy. Recently, empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that robust neural network models tend to have better interpretable gradients. Therefore, we speculate that improving the interpretability of the gradients of the neural network models may also help to improve the robustness of the models. Two methods are used to add gradient-dependent constraint terms to the loss function of neural network models and both improve the robustness of the models. The first method adds the fussed lasso penalty term of the saliency maps to the loss function of the neural network models, which makes the saliency maps arrange in a natural way to improve the interpretability of the saliency maps, and uses the gradient enhancement for relu instead of relu to strengthen the constraint of regularization term on saliency maps. In the second method, the cosine similarity penalty term between the input gradients and the image contour is added to the loss function of the model to constrain the approximation between the input gradients and the image contour. This method has a certain biological significance, because the contour information of the image is used in the human visual system to recognize the image. Both methods improve the interpretability of model`s gradients and the first method exceeds most regularization methods except adversarial training on MNIST and the second method even exceeds the adversarial training under white-box attacks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.}

  abstract = {Sheet metal coils are widely used in the steel, automotive, and electronics industries. Many of these coils are processed through metal stamping or laser cutting to form different types of shapes. Sheet metal coil leveling is an essential procedure before any metal forming process. In practice, this leveling procedure is now executed by operators and primarily relies on their experience, resulting in many trials and errors before settling on the correct machine parameters. In smart manufacturing, it is required to digitize the machine's parameters to achieve such a leveling process. Although smart manufacturing has been adopted in the manufacturing industry in recent years, it has not been implemented in steel leveling. In this paper, a novel leveling method for flatness leveling is proposed and validated with data collected by flatness sensors for measuring each roll adjustment position, which is later processed through the multi-regression method. The regression results and experienced machine operator results are compared. From this research, not only can the experience of the machine operators be digitized, but the results also indicate the feasibility of the proposed method to offer more efficient and accurate machine settings for metal leveling operations.}

After adversarial training, gradients of models with respect to their inputs are meaningful and interpretable by humans. However, the concept of interpretability is not mathematically well established, making it difficult to evaluate it quantitatively. We define interpretability as the alignment of the model gradient with the vector pointing toward the closest point of the support of the other class. We propose a method for measuring this alignment for binary classification problems, using generative adversarial model training to produce the smallest residual needed to change the class present in the image. We show that PGD-trained models are more interpretable than the baseline according to our definition, and our metric presents higher alignment values than a competing metric formulation. We also show that enforcing this alignment increases the robustness of models without adversarial training.},

The la- tent descriptor of a neural field acts as a deformation handle for the 3D shape it represents. Thus, smoothness with respect to this descriptor is paramount for performing shape-editing operations. In this work, we introduce a novel regularization designed to encourage smooth latent spaces in neural fields by penalizing the upper bound on the field's Lipschitz constant. Compared with prior Lipschitz regularized networks, ours is computationally fast, can be implemented in four lines of code, and requires minimal hyperparameter tuning for geometric applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on shape interpolation and extrapolation as well as partial shape reconstruction from 3D point clouds, showing both qualitative and quan- titative improvements over existing state-of-the-art and non-regularized baselines.},

Currently, DNN is a superior technique of extracting information from massive sets of data in a self-organized method.

Nevertheless, the training procedures of DNNs can be protracted depending on the given application and the size of the training set. Further, determining the most precise and practical structure of a deep learning method in a reasonable time is a possible problem related to this procedure. Meta-heuristics techniques, such as swarm intelligence (SI) and evolutionary computing (EC), represent optimization frames with specific theories and objective functions. These methods are adjustable and have been demonstrated their effectiveness in various applications; hence, they can optimize the DNNs models. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the recent optimization methods (i.e., SI and EC) employed to enhance DNNs performance on various tasks. This paper also analyzes the importance of optimization methods in generating the optimal hyper-parameters and structures of DNNs in taking into consideration massive-scale data. Finally, several potential directions that still need improvements and open problems in evolutionary DNNs are identified.},

Furthermore, we study a modality-agnostic single-backbone Transformer by sharing weights among the three modalities. We show that the convolution-free VATT outperforms state-of-the-art ConvNet-based architectures in the downstream tasks. Especially, VATT's vision Transformer achieves the top-1 accuracy of 82.1\% on Kinetics-400, 83.6\% on Kinetics-600,and 41.1\% on Moments in Time, new records while avoiding supervised pre-training. Transferring to image classification leads to 78.7\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet compared to 64.7\% by training the same Transformer from scratch, showing the generalizability of our model despite the domain gap between videos and images.

Also, the companies can create a strategy exclusively for certain types of problems, which will hasten the problem resolution. In this article, we propose an intelligent customer complaint management system (CCMS) for financial services organizations. We described a pre-processing technique for Turkish agglutinative language using deep learning algorithms and it was not previously considered in the literature. Furthermore, the performance of the algorithm has been significantly increased by choosing the appropriate combinations of pre-processing tasks.

The findings of the experiments show that the proposed approach is more effective than the other state-of-the-art strategies.},

  abstract = {Benefiting from the event-driven and sparse spiking characteristics of the brain, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are becoming an energy-efficient alternative to artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs has been a great hindrance to deploying SNNs ubiquitously for a long time. To leverage the full potential of SNNs, we study the effect of attention mechanisms in SNNs. We first present our idea of attention with a plug-and-play kit, termed the Multi-dimensional Attention (MA). Then, a new attention SNN architecture with end-to-end training called "MA-SNN" is proposed, which infers attention weights along the temporal, channel, as well as spatial dimensions separately or simultaneously. Based on the existing neuroscience theories, we exploit the attention weights to optimize membrane potentials, which in turn regulate the spiking response in a data-dependent way. At the cost of negligible additional parameters, MA facilitates vanilla SNNs to achieve sparser spiking activity, better performance, and energy efficiency concurrently. Experiments are conducted in event-based DVS128 Gesture/Gait action recognition and ImageNet-1k image classification. On Gesture/Gait, the spike counts are reduced by 84.9\%/81.6\%, and the task accuracy and energy efficiency are improved by 5.9\%/4.7\% and 3.4/3.2. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve top-1 accuracy of 75.92\% and 77.08\% on single/4-step Res-SNN-104, which are state-of-the-art results in SNNs. To our best knowledge, this is for the first time, that the SNN community achieves comparable or even better performance compared with its ANN counterpart in the large-scale dataset. Our work lights up SNN's potential as a general backbone to support various applications for SNNs, with a great balance between effectiveness and efficiency.},

We show that using our algorithm we can extract a lighter single-purpose binary classifier for a particular class by removing the parameters that do not participate in the predefined information path of that class, which is approximately 60\% of the total parameters. Notably, leveraging coding theory to design the information paths enables us to use intermediate network layers for making early predictions without having to evaluate the full network.

  abstract = {A method to increase the precision of feedforward networks is proposed. It requires prior knowledge of a target's function derivatives of several orders and uses this information in gradient-based training. Forward pass calculates not only the values of the output layer of a network but also their derivatives. The deviations of those derivatives from the target ones are used in an extended cost function, and then, the backward pass calculates the gradient of the extended cost with respect to weights, which is then used by a weights update algorithm. The most accurate approximation is obtained when the training starts with all available derivatives that are then step by step excluded from the extended cost function, starting with the highest orders up until only values are trained. Despite a substantial increase in arithmetic operations per pattern (compared with the conventional training), the method allows to obtain 140-1000 times more accurate approximation for simple cases if the total number of operations is equal. This precision also happens to be out of reach for the regular cost function. The method works well for solving differential equations with neural networks. The cost function is the deviation of the equation's residual from zero, and it can be extended by differentiating the equation itself so no prior information is required. This extension allows to solve 2-D nonlinear partial differential equation 13 times more accurately using seven times fewer grid points. The GPU-efficient algorithm for calculating the gradient of the extended cost function is proposed.},

  abstract = {Fully exploiting the learning capacity of neural networks requires overparameterized dense networks. On the other side, directly training sparse neural networks typically results in unsatisfactory performance. Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) provides a novel view to investigate sparse network training and maintain its capacity. Concretely, it claims there exist winning tickets from a randomly initialized network found by iterative magnitude pruning and preserving promising trainability (or we say being in trainable condition). In this work, we regard the winning ticket from LTH as the subnetwork which is in trainable condition and its performance as our benchmark, then go from a complementary direction to articulate the Dual Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (DLTH): Randomly selected subnetworks from a randomly initialized dense network can be transformed into a trainable condition and achieve admirable performance compared with LTH --- random tickets in a given lottery pool can be transformed into winning tickets. Specifically, by using uniform-randomly selected subnetworks to represent the general cases, we propose a simple sparse network training strategy, Random Sparse Network Transformation (RST), to substantiate our DLTH. Concretely, we introduce a regularization term to borrow learning capacity and realize information extrusion from the weights which will be masked. After finishing the transformation for the randomly selected subnetworks, we conduct the regular finetuning to evaluate the model using fair comparisons with LTH and other strong baselines. Extensive experiments on several public datasets and comparisons with competitive approaches validate our DLTH as well as the effectiveness of the proposed model RST. Our work is expected to pave a way for inspiring new research directions of sparse network training in the future. Our code is available at https://github.com/yueb17/DLTH.},

  abstract = {Learning in deep neural networks takes place by minimizing a nonconvex high-dimensional loss function, typically by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) strategy. The learning process is observed to be able to find good minimizers without getting stuck in local critical points and such minimizers are often satisfactory at avoiding overfitting. How these 2 features can be kept under control in nonlinear devices composed of millions of tunable connections is a profound and far-reaching open question. In this paper we study basic nonconvex 1- and 2-layer neural network models that learn random patterns and derive a number of basic geometrical and algorithmic features which suggest some answers. We first show that the error loss function presents few extremely wide flat minima (WFM) which coexist with narrower minima and critical points. We then show that the minimizers of the cross-entropy loss function overlap with the WFM of the error loss. We also show examples of learning devices for which WFM do not exist. From the algorithmic perspective we derive entropy-driven greedy and message-passing algorithms that focus their search on wide flat regions of minimizers. In the case of SGD and cross-entropy loss, we show that a slow reduction of the norm of the weights along the learning process also leads to WFM. We corroborate the results by a numerical study of the correlations between the volumes of the minimizers, their Hessian, and their generalization performance on real data.},

  abstract = {The success of deep learning has revealed the application potential of neural networks across the sciences and opened up fundamental theoretical problems. In particular, the fact that learning algorithms based on simple variants of gradient methods are able to find near-optimal minima of highly nonconvex loss functions is an unexpected feature of neural networks. Moreover, such algorithms are able to fit the data even in the presence of noise, and yet they have excellent predictive capabilities. Several empirical results have shown a reproducible correlation between the so-called flatness of the minima achieved by the algorithms and the generalization performance. At the same time, statistical physics results have shown that in nonconvex networks a multitude of narrow minima may coexist with a much smaller number of wide flat minima, which generalize well. Here, we show that wide flat minima arise as complex extensive structures, from the coalescence of minima around ``high-margin'' (i.e., locally robust) configurations. Despite being exponentially rare compared to zero-margin ones, high-margin minima tend to concentrate in particular regions. These minima are in turn surrounded by other solutions of smaller and smaller margin, leading to dense regions of solutions over long distances. Our analysis also provides an alternative analytical method for estimating when flat minima appear and when algorithms begin to find solutions, as the number of model parameters varies.},

Although, the problem has largely been overcome via carefully constructed initializations and batch normalization, architectures incorporating skip-connections such as highway and resnets perform much better than standard feedforward architectures despite well-chosen initialization and batch normalization. In this paper, we identify the shattered gradients problem. Specifically, we show that the correlation between gradients in standard feedforward networks decays exponentially with depth resulting in gradients that resemble white noise whereas, in contrast, the gradients in architectures with skip-connections are far more resistant to shattering, decaying sublinearly. Detailed empirical evidence is presented in support of the analysis, on both fully-connected networks and convnets. Finally, we present a new "looks linear" (LL) initialization that prevents shattering, with preliminary experiments showing the new initialization allows to train very deep networks without the addition of skip-connections.},

Although SGD methods are very effective in practice, most theoretical analyses of SGD suggest slower convergence than what is empirically observed. In our recent work [8] we analyzed how interpolation, common in modern over-parametrized learning, results in exponential convergence of SGD with constant step size for convex loss functions. In this note, we extend those results to a much broader non-convex function class satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. A number of important non-convex problems in machine learning, including some classes of neural networks, have been recently shown to satisfy the PL condition. We argue that the PL condition provides a relevant and attractive setting for many machine learning problems, particularly in the over-parametrized regime.},

Sociabilities are assumed to evolve over time, and are modelled via a dynamic point process model. The model is able to capture long term evolution of the sociabilities. Moreover, it yields sparse graphs, where the number of edges grows subquadratically with the number of nodes. The evolution of the sociabilities is described by a tractable time-varying generalised gamma process. We provide some theoretical insights into the model and apply it to three datasets: a simulated network, a network of hyperlinks between communities on Reddit, and a network of co-occurences of words in Reuters news articles after the September 11th attacks.},

We first propose a way to visualize the likelihood landscape leveraging an energy-based model interpretation of discriminative classifiers.

We observe that a subset of adversarial defense techniques results in a similar effect of flattening the likelihood landscape.

This deficiency is substantial enough that it is hard to compare pruning techniques to one another or determine how much progress the field has made over the past three decades. To address this situation, we identify issues with current practices, suggest concrete remedies, and introduce ShrinkBench, an open-source framework to facilitate standardized evaluations of pruning methods. We use ShrinkBench to compare various pruning techniques and show that its comprehensive evaluation can prevent common pitfalls when comparing pruning methods.},

A major theme of our study is that large-scale machine learning represents a distinctive setting in which the stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter. Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior, and highlight opportunities for designing algorithms with improved performance. This leads to a discussion about the next generation of optimization methods for large-scale machine learning, including an investigation of two main streams of research on techniques that diminish noise in the stochastic directions and methods that make use of second-order derivative approximations.},

We find that the agents establish successful communication by inducing visual representations that almost perfectly align with each other, but, surprisingly, do not capture the conceptual properties of the objects depicted in the input images. We conclude that, if we are interested in developing language-like communication systems, we must pay more attention to the visual semantics agents associate to the symbols they use.}

We derive a baseline algorithm called LinBreg, an accelerated version using momentum, and AdaBreg, which is a Bregmanized generalization of the Adam algorithm. In contrast to established methods for sparse training the proposed family of algorithms constitutes a regrowth strategy for neural networks that is solely optimization-based without additional heuristics.  Our Bregman learning framework starts the training with very few initial parameters, successively adding only significant ones to obtain a sparse and expressive network. The proposed approach is extremely easy and efficient, yet supported by the rich mathematical theory of inverse scale space methods. We derive a statistically profound sparse parameter initialization strategy and provide a rigorous stochastic convergence analysis of the loss decay and additional convergence proofs in the convex regime. Using only  of the parameters of ResNet-18 we achieve  test accuracy on CIFAR-10, compared to  using the dense network. Our algorithm also unveils an autoencoder architecture for a denoising task. The proposed framework also has a huge potential for integrating sparse backpropagation and resource-friendly training. Code is available at https://github.com/TimRoith/BregmanLearning.},

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

In an attempt to bridge this gap, we study the problem of learning a two-layer over-parameterized neural network, when the data is generated by a linearly separable function. In the case where the network has Leaky ReLU activations, we provide both optimization and generalization guarantees for over-parameterized networks. Specifically, we prove convergence rates of SGD to a global minimum and provide generalization guarantees for this global minimum that are independent of the network size. Therefore, our result clearly shows that the use of SGD for optimization both finds a global minimum, and avoids overfitting despite the high capacity of the model. This is the first theoretical demonstration that SGD can avoid overfitting, when learning over-specified neural network classifiers.},

Using statistical tests, we empirically confirm that a synchrony propensity appears in the market, where a buy order arrival tends to follow the sell order's long-term mean level and vice versa. This is presumably closely related to the drastic increase in the influence of high-frequency trading activities in markets. To solve the high-dimensional Hamilton{\textendash}Jacobi{\textendash}Bellman equation, we propose a deep neural network approximation and theoretically verify the existence of a network structure that guarantees a sufficiently small loss function. Finally, we implement the terminal profit and loss profile of market-making using the estimated optimal strategy and compare its performance distribution with that of other feasible strategies. We find that our estimation of the optimal market-making placement allows significantly stable and steady profit accumulation over time through the implementation of strict inventory management.}

Two objectives, the size and the total weight of a clique, are considered. In particular, the larger size in terms of set inclusion and the higher total weight a clique is, the better it is. This problem is termed BiOWCP which is a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem that contains conflict objectives. We show that BiOWCP cannot be translated into the clique problem of a weighted graph with positive vertex weights (WG-P) via a straight forward transformation, which highlights the difficulty of BiOWCP. We propose a heavy perturbation (HP)-based NSGAII (nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II) algorithm HP-NSGAII for the problem, where the perturbation is done by either improving a selected elitist with a local search procedure or swapping its left and right parts. Benchmarks for BiOWCP were adapted from the DIMACS set. Extensive experiments were carried out for different ratios of the heavy perturbation effort to the total search effort. Computational results show that HP-NSGAII is superior to NSGAII on many problems with respect to the hyper volume indicator and the set coverage indicator.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of deep learning, the sizes of neural networks become larger and larger so that the training and inference often overwhelm the hardware resources. Given the fact that neural networks are often over-parameterized, one effective way to reduce such computational overhead is neural network pruning, by removing redundant parameters from trained neural networks. It has been recently observed that pruning can not only reduce computational overhead but also can improve empirical robustness of deep neural networks (NNs), potentially owing to removing spurious correlations while preserving the predictive accuracies. This paper for the first time demonstrates that pruning can generally improve certified robustness for ReLU-based NNs under the complete verification setting. Using the popular Branch-and-Bound (BaB) framework, we find that pruning can enhance the estimated bound tightness of certified robustness verification, by alleviating linear relaxation and sub-domain split problems. We empirically verify our findings with off-the-shelf pruning methods and further present a new stability-based pruning method tailored for reducing neuron instability, that outperforms existing pruning methods in enhancing certified robustness. Our experiments show that by appropriately pruning an NN, its certified accuracy can be boosted up to 8.2\% under standard training, and up to 24.5\% under adversarial training on the CIFAR10 dataset. We additionally observe the existence of certified lottery tickets that can match both standard and certified robust accuracies of the original dense models across different datasets. Our findings offer a new angle to study the intriguing interaction between sparsity and robustness, i.e. interpreting the interaction of sparsity and certified robustness via neuron stability.

This is an old problem of renewed interest because of the need to compress ever larger nets so they can run in mobile devices. Pruning has been traditionally done by ranking or penalizing weights according to some criterion (such as magnitude), removing low-ranked weights and retraining the remaining ones. We formulate pruning as an optimization problem of finding the weights that minimize the loss while satisfying a pruning cost condition. We give a generic algorithm to solve this which alternates "learning" steps that optimize a regularized, data-dependent loss and "compression" steps that mark weights for pruning in a data-independent way. Magnitude thresholding arises naturally in the compression step, but unlike existing magnitude pruning approaches, our algorithm explores subsets of weights rather than committing irrevocably to a specific subset from the beginning. It is also able to learn automatically the best number of weights to prune in each layer of the net without incurring an exponentially costly model selection. Using a single pruning-level user parameter, we achieve state-of-the-art pruning in LeNet and ResNets of various sizes.},

  abstract = {Various factorization-based methods have been proposed to leverage second-order, or higher-order cross features for boosting the performance of predictive models. They generally enumerate all the cross features under a predefined maximum order, and then identify useful feature interactions through model training, which suffer from two drawbacks. First, they have to make a trade-off between the expressiveness of higher-order cross features and the computational cost, resulting in suboptimal predictions. Second, enumerating all the cross features, including irrelevant ones, may introduce noisy feature combinations that degrade model performance. In this work, we propose the Adaptive Factorization Network (AFN), a new model that learns arbitrary-order cross features adaptively from data. The core of AFN is a logarithmic transformation layer to convert the power of each feature in a feature combination into the coefficient to be learned. The experimental results on four real datasets demonstrate the superior predictive performance of AFN against the start-of-the-arts.},

In contrast to traditional dynamic optimization problems where the changes are caused by some objective factors, the changes in such incremental optimization problems are usually caused by the modifications made by the decision makers during the design process. While existing work in the literature is mainly focused on traditional dynamic optimization, little research has been dedicated to solving such incremental optimization problems. In this work, we study how to adopt cooperative coevolution to efficiently solve a specific type of incremental optimization problems, namely, those with increasing decision variables. First, we present a benchmark function generator on the basis of some basic formulations of incremental optimization problems with increasing decision variables and exploitable modular structure. Then, we propose a contribution based cooperative coevolutionary framework coupled with an incremental grouping method for dealing with them. On one hand, the benchmark function generator is capable of generating various benchmark functions with various characteristics. On the other hand, the proposed framework is promising in solving such problems in terms of both optimization accuracy and computational efficiency. In addition, the proposed method is further assessed using a real-world application, i.e., the design optimization of a stepped cantilever beam.},

Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present Wide \& Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems.

Despite significant effort and progress in this field, the existing prediction methods are either limited by the number of input variables or restricted to those financial predictors. To alleviate those issues, both financial variables and non-financial variables are screened out from the existing accounting and finance theory to use as financial distress predictors. In addition, a novel method for financial distress prediction (FDP) based on sparse neural networks is proposed, namely FDP-SNN, in which the weight of the hidden layer is constrained with \$\$L\_\{1/2\}\$\$regularization to achieve the sparsity, so as to select relevant and important predictors, improving the predicted accuracy. It also provides support for the interpretability of the model. The results show that non-financial variables, such as investor protection and governance structure, play a key role in financial distress prediction than those financial ones, especially when the forecast period grows longer. By comparing those classic models proposed by predominant researchers in accounting and finance, the proposed model outperforms in terms of accuracy, precision, and AUC performance.},

However, the existing pruning methods are usually heuristic, task-specified, and require an extra fine-tuning procedure. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework that compresses DNNs into slimmer architectures with competitive performances and significant FLOPs reductions by Only-Train-Once (OTO). OTO contains two key steps: (i) we partition the parameters of DNNs into zero-invariant groups, enabling us to prune zero groups without affecting the output; and (ii) to promote zero groups, we then formulate a structured-sparsity optimization problem, and propose a novel optimization algorithm, Half-Space Stochastic Projected Gradient (HSPG), to solve it, which outperforms the standard proximal methods on group sparsity exploration, and maintains comparable convergence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of OTO, we train and compress full models simultaneously from scratch without fine-tuning for inference speedup and parameter reduction, and achieve state-of-the-art results on VGG16 for CIFAR10, ResNet50 for CIFAR10 and Bert for SQuAD and competitive result on ResNet50 for ImageNet.

Fault diagnosis for single device open-circuit fault of three-level inverter based on BP (back propagation) neural network is studied in this paper. One of the weak-points of BP algorithm which is commonly used is that the optimal procedure is easily stacked into the local minimal value and cause strict demands of initial value. So a fault diagnosis method based on BP neural network and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, bridge voltage of three-level inverter is collected as fault signal and feature is extracted to determine the structure of the BP neural network. After this, GA is applied to optimize the initial weights and thresholds of BP neural network, and then the network is trained to diagnose faults of three-level inverter to determine the specific failure device. The simulation result shows that the method can isolate fault modes proposed exactly, and the weak-point of network can effectively avoid, improve the diagnostic accuracy.},

Existing works empower the models by massive data, such as large-scale pretraining and/or repeated strong data augmentations, and still report optimization-related problems (e.g., sensitivity to initialization and learning rate). Hence, this paper investigates ViTs and MLP-Mixers from the lens of loss geometry, intending to improve the models' data efficiency at training and generalization at inference. Visualization and Hessian reveal extremely sharp local minima of converged models. By promoting smoothness with a recently proposed sharpness-aware optimizer, we substantially improve the accuracy and robustness of ViTs and MLP-Mixers on various tasks spanning supervised, adversarial, contrastive, and transfer learning (e.g., +5.3{\textbackslash}\% and +11.0{\textbackslash}\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet for ViT-B/16 and Mixer-B/16, respectively, with the simple Inception-style preprocessing). We show that the improved smoothness attributes to sparser active neurons in the first few layers. The resultant ViTs outperform ResNets of similar size and throughput when trained from scratch on ImageNet without large-scale pretraining or strong data augmentations. They also possess more perceptive attention maps.},

These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully decoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical values of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered. Finally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the network size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum often leads to overfitting.},

Quite surprisingly training the neural network via (stochastic) gradient descent leads to models that generalize very well, while classical statistics would suggest overfitting. In order to gain understanding of this implicit bias phenomenon we study the special case of sparse recovery (compressed sensing) which is of interest on its own. More precisely, in order to reconstruct a vector from underdetermined linear measurements, we introduce a corresponding overparameterized square loss functional, where the vector to be reconstructed is deeply factorized into several vectors. We show that, if there exists an exact solution, vanilla gradient flow for the overparameterized loss functional converges to a good approximation of the solution of minimal \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-norm. The latter is well-known to promote sparse solutions. As a by-product, our results significantly improve the sample complexity for compressed sensing via gradient flow/descent on overparameterized models derived in previous works. The theory accurately predicts the recovery rate in numerical experiments. Our proof relies on analyzing a certain Bregman divergence of the flow. This bypasses the obstacles caused by non-convexity and should be of independent interest.},

Unfortunately, for such large architectures the number of parameters usually grows quadratically in the width of the network, thus necessitating hand-coded "local receptive fields" that limit the number of connections from lower level features to higher ones (e.g., based on spatial locality).  In this paper we propose a fast method to choose these connections that may be incorporated into a wide variety of unsupervised training methods.  Specifically, we choose local receptive fields that group together those low-level features that are most similar to each other according to a pairwise similarity metric.  This approach  allows us to harness the advantages of local receptive fields (such  as improved scalability, and reduced data requirements) when we do  not know how to specify such receptive fields by hand or where our  unsupervised training algorithm has no obvious generalization to a  topographic setting.  We produce results showing how this method allows us to use even simple unsupervised training algorithms to train successful multi-layered etworks that achieve state-of-the-art results on CIFAR and STL datasets: 82.0\% and 60.1\% accuracy, respectively.},

Most notably, we introduce a new environment called CoinRun, designed as a benchmark for generalization in RL. Using CoinRun, we find that agents overfit to surprisingly large training sets. We then show that deeper convolutional architectures improve generalization, as do methods traditionally found in supervised learning, including L2 regularization, dropout, data augmentation and batch normalization.},

We show that using our algorithm we can extract a lighter single-purpose binary classifier for a particular class by removing the parameters that do not participate in the predefined information path of that class, which is approximately 60\% of the total parameters. Notably, leveraging coding theory to design the information paths enables us to use intermediate network layers for making early predictions without having to evaluate the full network.

This paper proposes CURIOUS, an algorithm that leverages 1) a modular Universal Value Function Approximator with hindsight learning to achieve a diversity of goals of different kinds within a unique policy and 2) an automated curriculum learning mechanism that biases the attention of the agent towards goals maximizing the absolute learning progress. Agents focus sequentially on goals of increasing complexity, and focus back on goals that are being forgotten.

In this work, we focus on comparing and analyzing the shape bias between CNN- and transformer-based models from the view of VST tasks. For comprehensive comparisons, we propose three kinds of transformer-based visual style transfer (Tr-VST) methods (Tr-NST for optimization-based VST, Tr-WCT for reconstruction-based VST and Tr-AdaIN for perceptual-based VST). By engaging three mainstream VST methods in the transformer pipeline, we show that transformer-based models pre-trained on ImageNet are not proper for style transfer methods. Due to the strong shape bias of the transformer-based models, these Tr-VST methods cannot render style patterns. We further analyze the shape bias by considering the inuence of the learned parameters and the structure design. Results prove that with proper style supervision, the transformer can learn similar texture-biased features as CNN does. With the reduced shape bias in the transformer encoder, Tr-VST methods can generate higher-quality results compared with state-of-the-art VST methods.},

  abstract = {Continual learning (CL) refers to the ability of an intelligent system to sequentially acquire and retain knowledge from a stream of data with as little computational overhead as possible. To this end; regularization, replay, architecture, and parameter isolation approaches were introduced to the literature. Parameter isolation using a sparse network which enables to allocate distinct parts of the neural network to different tasks and also allows to share of parameters between tasks if they are similar. Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) is a prominent way to find these sparse networks and isolate them for each task. This paper is the first empirical study investigating the effect of different DST components under the CL paradigm to fill a critical research gap and shed light on the optimal configuration of DST for CL if it exists. Therefore, we perform a comprehensive study in which we investigate various DST components to find the best topology per task on well-known CIFAR100 and miniImageNet benchmarks in a task-incremental CL setup since our primary focus is to evaluate the performance of various DST criteria, rather than the process of mask selection. We found that, at a low sparsity level, Erdos-Renyi Kernel (ERK) initialization utilizes the backbone more efficiently and allows to effectively learn increments of tasks. At a high sparsity level, however, uniform initialization demonstrates more reliable and robust performance. In terms of growth strategy; performance is dependent on the defined initialization strategy, and the extent of sparsity. Finally, adaptivity within DST components is a promising way for better continual learners.},

AQL adaptively partitions the state{\textendash}action space of a   Markov decision process   (MDP), while learning the control policy,   i.e.  , the mapping from states to actions. The main difference between AQL and SPAQL is that the latter learns time-invariant policies, where the mapping from states to actions does not depend explicitly on the time step. This paper also proposes the SPAQL with terminal state (SPAQL-TS), an improved version of SPAQL tailored for the design of regulators for control problems. The time-invariant policies are shown to result in a better performance than the time-variant ones in both problems studied. These algorithms are particularly fitted to RL problems where the action space is finite, as is the case with the   CartPole  ~problem. SPAQL-TS solves the   OpenAI Gym  ~  CartPole  ~problem, while also displaying a higher sample efficiency than   trust region policy optimization   (TRPO), a standard RL algorithm for solving control tasks. Moreover, the policies learned by SPAQL are interpretable, while TRPO policies are typically encoded as neural networks, and therefore hard to interpret. Yielding interpretable policies while being sample-efficient are the major advantages of SPAQL.

Yet, this efficiency is just in theory. In practice, everyone uses a binary mask to simulate sparsity since the typical deep learning software and hardware are optimized for dense matrix operations. In this paper, we take an orthogonal approach, and we show that we can train truly sparse neural networks to harvest their full potential. To achieve this goal, we introduce three novel contributions, specially designed for sparse neural networks: (1) a parallel training algorithm and its corresponding sparse implementation from scratch, (2) an activation function with non-trainable parameters to favour the gradient flow, and (3) a hidden neurons importance metric to eliminate redundancies. All in one, we are able to break the record and to train the largest neural network ever trained in terms of representational power -- reaching the bat brain size. The results show that our approach has state-of-the-art performance while opening the path for an environmentally friendly artificial intelligence era.},

  abstract = {Sorting an array is a fundamental routine in machine learning, one that is used to compute rank-based statistics, cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), quantiles, or to select closest neighbors and labels. The sorting function is however piece-wise constant (the sorting permutation of a vector does not change if the entries of that vector are infinitesimally perturbed) and therefore has no gradient information to back-propagate. We propose a framework to sort elements that is algorithmically differentiable. We leverage the fact that sorting can be seen as a particular instance of the optimal transport (OT) problem on \${\textbackslash}backslashmathbb\{R\}\$, from input values to a predefined array of sorted values (e.g. \$1,2,{\textbackslash}backslashdots,n\$ if the input array has \$n\$ elements). Building upon this link , we propose generalized CDFs and quantile operators by varying the size and weights of the target presorted array. Because this amounts to using the so-called Kantorovich formulation of OT, we call these quantities K-sorts, K-CDFs and K-quantiles. We recover differentiable algorithms by adding to the OT problem an entropic regularization, and approximate it using a few Sinkhorn iterations. We call these operators S-sorts, S-CDFs and S-quantiles, and use them in various learning settings: we benchmark them against the recently proposed neuralsort [Grover et al. 2019], propose applications to quantile regression and introduce differentiable formulations of the top-k accuracy that deliver state-of-the art performance.},

  abstract = {When training neural networks, the use of Synthetic Gradients (SG) allows layers or modules to be trained without update locking-without waiting for a true error gradient to be backprop-agated-resulting in Decoupled Neural Interfaces (DNIs). This unlocked ability of being able to update parts of a neural network asyn-chronously and with only local information was demonstrated to work empirically in Jaderberg et al. (2016). However, there has been very little demonstration of what changes DNIs and SGs impose from a functional, representational, and learning dynamics point of view. In this paper, we study DNIs through the use of synthetic gradients on feed-forward networks to better understand their behaviour and elucidate their effect on optimisation. We show that the incorporation of SGs does not affect the representational strength of the learning system for a neural network , and prove the convergence of the learning system for linear and deep linear models. On practical problems we investigate the mechanism by which synthetic gradient estimators approximate the true loss, and, surprisingly, how that leads to drastically different layer-wise representations. Finally, we also expose the relationship of using synthetic gradients to other error approximation techniques and find a unifying language for discussion and comparison.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful machine learning paradigm for solving Markov Decision Process (MDP). Traditional RL algorithms aim to solve one-objective problems, but many real-world problems have more than one objective which conflict each other. In recent years, Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms, which employ a reward vector instead of a scalar reward signal, have been proposed to solve multi-objective problems. In MORL, because of conflicting objectives, there is no one optimal solution and a set of solutions named Pareto Front will be learned. In this paper, we proposed a new multi-agent method, which uses a shared Q-table for all agents to solve bi-objective problems. However, each agent selects actions based on its preference. These preferences are different with each other and the agents reach to Pareto Front solutions based on this preferences. The proposed method is simple in understanding and its computational cost is very low. Moreover, after finding the Pareto Front set, we can easily track the policy. Simulation results show that our proposed method outperforms the available methods in the term of learning speed.},

Typically, kernels are designed beforehand for a data type which either exploit statistics of the structures or make use of probabilistic generative models, and then a discriminative classifier is learned based on the kernels via convex optimization. However, such an elegant two-stage approach also limited kernel methods from scaling up to millions of data points, and exploiting discriminative information to learn feature representations. We propose, structure2vec, an effective and scalable approach for structured data representation based on the idea of embedding latent variable models into feature spaces, and learning such feature spaces using discriminative information. Interestingly, structure2vec extracts features by performing a sequence of function mappings in a way similar to graphical model inference procedures, such as mean field and belief propagation. In applications involving millions of data points, we showed that structure2vec runs 2 times faster, produces models which are \$10,000\$ times smaller, while at the same time achieving the state-of-the-art predictive performance.},

We use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the policies of these agents end-to-end {\textendash} from pixels to multi-agent multi-round dialog to game reward. We demonstrate two experimental results. First, as a 'sanity check' demonstration of pure RL (from scratch), we show results on a synthetic world, where the agents communicate in ungrounded vocabulary, i.e., symbols with no pre-specified meanings (X, Y, Z). We find that two bots invent their own communication protocol and start using certain symbols to ask/answer about certain visual attributes (shape/color/style). Thus, we demonstrate the emergence of grounded language and communication among 'visual' dialog agents with no human supervision. Second, we conduct large-scale real-image experiments on the VisDial dataset, where we pretrain with supervised dialog data and show that the RL 'fine-tuned' agents significantly outperform SL agents. Interestingly, the RL Qbot learns to ask questions that Abot is good at, ultimately resulting in more informative dialog and a better team.},

We propose a novel three-layered deep learning model that assiminlate or learns independently global and local contextual information alongside visual features. The novelty of the proposed model is that One-vs-All binary class-based learners are introduced to learn Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimized features in the visual layer, followed by the contextual layer that learns global and local contexts of an image, and finally the third layer integrates all the information optimally to obtain the final class label. Stanford Background and CamVid benchmark image parsing datasets were used for our model evaluation, and our model shows promising results. The empirical analysis reveals that optimized visual features with global and local contextual information play a significant role to improve accuracy and produce stable predictions comparable to state-of-the-art deep CNN models.},

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called ``ImageNet'', a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500{\textendash}1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

These models deliver impressive accuracy, but each image evaluation requires millions of floating point operations, making their deployment on smartphones and Internet-scale clusters problematic. The computation is dominated by the convolution operations in the lower layers of the model. We exploit the redundancy present within the convolutional filters to derive approximations that significantly reduce the required computation. Using large state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate speedups of convolutional layers on both CPU and GPU by a factor of 2{\texttimes}, while keeping the accuracy within 1\% of the original model.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate the possibility of what we call sparse learning: accelerated training of deep neural networks that maintain sparse weights throughout training while achieving dense performance levels. We accomplish this by developing sparse momentum, an algorithm which uses exponentially smoothed gradients (momentum) to identify layers and weights which reduce the error efficiently. Sparse momentum redistributes pruned weights across layers according to the mean momentum magnitude of each layer. Within a layer, sparse momentum grows weights according to the momentum magnitude of zero-valued weights. We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet, decreasing the mean error by a relative 8\%, 15\%, and 6\% compared to other sparse algorithms. Furthermore, we show that sparse momentum reliably reproduces dense performance levels while providing up to 5.61x faster training. In our analysis, ablations show that the benefits of momentum redistribution and growth increase with the depth and size of the network. Additionally, we find that sparse momentum is insensitive to the choice of its hyperparameters suggesting that sparse momentum is robust and easy to use.},

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

In this position paper, we elucidate unique characteristics and capabilities of a DT framework that enables realization of such promises as online learning of a physical environment, real-time monitoring of assets, Monte Carlo heuristic search for predictive prevention, on-policy, and off-policy reinforcement learning in real-time. We establish a conceptual layered architecture for a DT framework with decentralized implementation on cloud computing and enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) services for modeling, event detection, and decision-making processes. The DT framework separates the control functions, deployed as a system of logically centralized process, from the physical devices under control, much like software-defined networking (SDN) in fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. We discuss the moment of the DT framework in facilitating implementation of network-based control processes and its implications for critical infrastructure. To clarify the significance of DT in lowering the risk of development and deployment of innovative technologies on existing system, we discuss the application of implementing zero trust architecture (ZTA) as a necessary security framework in future data-driven communication networks.},

Inspired by the linearity of convolution, we seek to make some filters increasingly close and eventually identical for network slimming. To this end, we propose Centripetal SGD (C-SGD), a novel optimization method, which can train several filters to collapse into a single point in the parameter hyperspace. When the training is completed, the removal of the identical filters can trim the network with NO performance loss, thus no finetuning is needed. By doing so, we have partly solved an open problem of constrained filter pruning on CNNs with complicated structure, where some layers must be pruned following the others. Our experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet have justified the effectiveness of C-SGD-based filter pruning. Moreover, we have provided empirical evidences for the assumption that the redundancy in deep neural networks helps the convergence of training by showing that a redundant CNN trained using C-SGD outperforms a normally trained counterpart with the equivalent width.},

Nevertheless, the accompanying increase in computational complexity makes the model difficult to implement on resource-limited mobile devices. Pruning connections are one of the main methods used for deep network compression. The existing pruning techniques suffer from disadvantages such as generating additional energy consumption, short practical estimation of channel importance, and leading the network to fall into overfitting. In this paper, we propose a channel pruning method based on the SE mechanism and upper quartile truncation, which uses the SE mechanism to extract the channel feature importance and upper quartile points as truncation factors to accelerate the model and reduce its computational effort, and the effectiveness of the method was demonstrated by experiments.},

In this paper, we show that the task is impossible because the original result for 1-hidden-layer network in [59] can not hold. More specifically, we prove that for any multi-layer network with generic input data and non-linear activation functions, sub-optimal local minima can exist, no matter how wide the network is (as long as the last hidden layer has at least two neurons). While the result of [59] assumes sigmoid activation, our counter-example covers a large set of activation functions (dense in the set of continuous functions), indicating that the limitation is not due to the specific activation. Our result indicates that "no bad local-min" may be unable to explain the benefit of over-parameterization for training neural nets.},

We argue for reporting additional details, especially performance on validation data obtained during model development. We present a novel technique for doing so: expected validation performance of the best-found model as a function of computation budget (i.e., the number of hyperparameter search trials or the overall training time). Using our approach, we find multiple recent model comparisons where authors would have reached a different conclusion if they had used more (or less) computation. Our approach also allows us to estimate the amount of computation required to obtain a given accuracy; applying it to several recently published results yields massive variation across papers, from hours to weeks. We conclude with a set of best practices for reporting experimental results which allow for robust future comparisons, and provide code to allow researchers to use our technique.},

We extend FCNs by adding short skip connections, that are similar to the ones introduced in residual networks, in order to build very deep FCNs (of hundreds of layers). A review of the gradient flow confirms that for a very deep FCN it is beneficial to have both long and short skip connections.

In normal backpropagation training, minimizing the energy function tends to push the input gradient to zero. However, this is not always possible. Double backpropagation explicitly pushes the input gradients to zero, making the minimum broader, and increases the generalization on the test data.

This leads to a long training time for dense neural networks to achieve good performance. Hence, prohibitive computation and memory resources are consumed. Recently, learning efficient DRL agents has received increasing attention. Yet, current methods focus on accelerating inference time. In this paper, we introduce for the first time a dynamic sparse training approach for deep reinforcement learning to accelerate the training process. The proposed approach trains a sparse neural network from scratch and dynamically adapts its topology to the changing data distribution during training. Experiments on continuous control tasks show that our dynamic sparse agents achieve higher performance than the equivalent dense methods, reduce the parameter count and floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 50\%, and have a faster learning speed that enables reaching the performance of dense agents with 40-50\% reduction in the training steps.},

Viz., models that are optimized to have interpretable gradients are more robust to adversarial examples than models trained in a standard manner. With further analysis and experiments on standard image classification datasets, we identify two factors behind this phenomenon{\textemdash}namely the suppression of the gradient's magnitude and the selective use of features guided by high-quality interpretations{\textemdash}which explain model behaviors under various regularization and target interpretation settings.},

We collected and publicly provide a data set with over half a billion filters from hundreds of trained CNNs, using a wide range of data sets, architectures, and vision tasks. Our analysis shows interesting distribution shifts (or the lack thereof) between trained filters along different axes of meta-parameters, like data type, task, architecture, or layer depth.

  abstract = {In the recent years, deep learning techniques have shown great success in various tasks related to inverse problems, where a target quantity of interest can only be observed through indirect measurements by a forward operator. Common approaches apply deep neural networks in a post-processing step to the reconstructions obtained by classical reconstruction methods. However, the latter methods can be computationally expensive and introduce artifacts that are not present in the measured data and, in turn, can deteriorate the performance on the given task. To overcome these limitations, we propose a class of equivariant neural networks that can be directly applied to the measurements to solve the desired task. To this end, we build appropriate network structures by developing layers that are equivariant with respect to data transformations induced by well-known symmetries in the domain of the forward operator. We rigorously analyze the relation between the measurement operator and the resulting group representations and prove a representer theorem that characterizes the class of linear operators that translate between a given pair of group actions. Based on this theory, we extend the existing concepts of Lie group equivariant deep learning to inverse problems and introduce new representations that result from the involved measurement operations. This allows us to efficiently solve classification, regression or even reconstruction tasks based on indirect measurements also for very sparse data problems, where a classical reconstruction-based approach may be hard or even impossible. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in numerical experiments and compare with existing methods.},

  abstract = {Much recent research has been devoted to learning algorithms for deep architectures such as Deep Belief Networks and stacks of auto-encoder variants, with impressive results obtained in several areas, mostly on vision and language data sets. The best results obtained on supervised learning tasks involve an unsupervised learning component, usually in an unsupervised pre-training phase. Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this difficult learning problem. The main question investigated here is the following: how does unsupervised pre-training work? Answering this questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We propose several explanatory hypotheses and test them through extensive simulations. We empirically show the influence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples. The experiments confirm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. The results suggest that unsupervised pre-training guides the learning towards basins of attraction of minima that support better generalization from the training data set; the evidence from these results supports a regularization explanation for the effect of pre-training.},

Additionally, our attempts to find a decreasing objective path from "bad" solutions to the "good" ones in the sparse subspace fail. However, if we allow the path to traverse the dense subspace, then we consistently find a path between two solutions. These findings suggest traversing extra dimensions may be needed to escape stationary points found in the sparse subspace.},

In this work, we attempt to answer: (1) why training unstructured sparse networks from random initialization performs poorly and; (2) what makes LTs and DST the exceptions? We show that sparse NNs have poor gradient flow at initialization and propose a modified initialization for unstructured connectivity. Furthermore, we find that DST methods significantly improve gradient flow during training over traditional sparse training methods. Finally, we show that LTs do not improve gradient flow, rather their success lies in re-learning the pruning solution they are derived from - however, this comes at the cost of learning novel solutions.},

Our method updates the topology of the sparse network during training by using parameter magnitudes and infrequent gradient calculations. We show that this approach requires fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) to achieve a given level of accuracy compared to prior techniques. We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse training results on a variety of networks and datasets, including ResNet-50, MobileNets on Imagenet-2012, and RNNs on WikiText-103.

However, non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed coupling is a ubiquitous phenomenon in DNNs. Here, by weaving together theories of heavy-tailed random matrices and non-equilibrium statistical physics, we develop a new type of mean field theory for DNNs which predicts that heavy-tailed weights enable the emergence of an extended critical regime without fine-tuning parameters. In this extended critical regime, DNNs exhibit rich and complex propagation dynamics across layers. We further elucidate that the extended criticality endows DNNs with profound computational advantages: balancing the contraction as well as expansion of internal neural representations and speeding up training processes, hence providing a theoretical guide for the design of efficient neural architectures.},

  abstract = {Pruning is a model compression method that removes redundant parameters in deep neural networks (DNNs) while maintaining accuracy. Most available filter pruning methods require complex treatments such as iterative pruning, features statistics/ranking, or additional optimization designs in the training process. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective regularization strategy from a new perspective of evolution of features, which we call feature flow regularization (FFR), for improving structured sparsity and filter pruning in DNNs. Specifically, FFR imposes controls on the gradient and curvature of feature flow along the neural network, which implicitly increases the sparsity of the parameters. The principle behind FFR is that coherent and smooth evolution of features will lead to an efficient network that avoids redundant parameters. The high structured sparsity obtained from FFR enables us to prune filters effectively. Experiments with VGGNets, ResNets on CIFAR-10/100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets demonstrate that FFR can significantly improve both unstructured and structured sparsity. Our pruning results in terms of reduction of parameters and FLOPs are comparable to or even better than those of state-of-the-art pruning methods.},

In this study, we propose a field-aware attentive neural factorization machine (FAFM) model for large-scale data-driven company investment valuation. The proposed FAFM model utilizes the advantage of factorization machine (FM) to efficiently capture nonlinear feature interactions in a sparse dataset. We additionally consider field heterogeneity among features with fuzzy mutual information and develop an attention neural network to learn predictive strengths of pair-wise feature interactions. FAFM contributes to the literature by overcoming the limitation of FM that ignores field heterogeneity by factorizing pair-wise feature interactions with same weight. Further more, FAFM learns the prediction strengths in a stratified manner by using the attention deep learning mechanism, which demonstrates more structured control ability and allows for more leverage in tweaking the interactions in the feature-wise level. Experiments are conducted on a unique real dataset set consisting of 3,500 listed companies in the Chinese market with features from eight fields: demographics, annual reports, stock financial disclosure, land use, intellectual property, tax, bond financing, and certification. Results showed the superiority of FAFM on prediction accuracy and model interpretability over existing baselines.

  abstract = {With the help of network compression algorithms, deep neural networks can be applied on low-power embedded systems and mobile devices such as drones, satellites, and smartphones. Filter pruning is a sub-direction of network compression research, which reduces memory and computational consumption by reducing the number of parameters of model filters. Previous works utilized the "more-simple-less-important" criterion for pruning filters. That is, filters with the smaller norm or more sparse weights in the network are preferentially pruned. In this paper, we found that feature maps are not fully positively correlated with the sparsity of filter weights by observing the visualization of feature maps and the corresponding filters. Hence, we came up with the idea that the priority of filter pruning should be determined by redundancy rather than sparsity. The redundancy of a filter is the measure of whether the output of the filter is repeated with other filters. Based on this, we defined a criterion called redundancy index to rank the filters and introduced it into our filter pruning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different model architectures, including VGGNet, GoogleNet, DenseNet, and ResNet. The models compressed with our strategy surpass the state-of-the-art in terms of Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPs), parameters reduction, and classification accuracy.},

When observing the actions of others, humans make inferences about why they acted as they did, and what this implies about the world; humans also use the fact that their actions will be interpreted in this manner, allowing them to act informatively and thereby communicate efficiently with others. Although learning algorithms have recently achieved superhuman performance in a number of two-player, zero-sum games, scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms that can discover effective strategies and conventions in complex, partially observable settings have proven elusive. We present the Bayesian action decoder (BAD), a new multi-agent learning method that uses an approximate Bayesian update to obtain a public belief that conditions on the actions taken by all agents in the environment. BAD introduces a new Markov decision process, the public beliefMDP, in which the action space consists of all deterministic partial policies, and exploits the fact that an agent acting only on this public belief state can still learn to use its private information if the action space is augmented to be over all partial policies mapping private information into environment actions. The Bayesian update is closely related to the theory of mind reasoning that humans carry out when observing others' actions. Wc first validate BAD on a proof-of-principle two-step matrix game, where it outperforms policy gradient methods; we then evaluate BAD on the challenging, cooperative partial-information card game Hanabi, where, in the two-player setting, it surpasses all previously published learning and hand-coded approaches, establishing a new state of the art.}

While deep ensembles were theoretically motivated by the bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable variational Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of functions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random initializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an optimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a single mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight space. Developing the concept of the diversity--accuracy plane, we show that the decorrelation power of random initializations is unmatched by popular subspace sampling methods. Finally, we evaluate the relative effects of ensembling, subspace based methods and ensembles of subspace based methods, and the experimental results validate our hypothesis.},

We find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the "lottery ticket hypothesis:" dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks ("winning tickets") that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective. We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20\% of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.},

We show that, unlike pruning after training, randomly shuffling the weights these methods prune within each layer or sampling new initial values preserves or improves accuracy. As such, the per-weight pruning decisions made by these methods can be replaced by a per-layer choice of the fraction of weights to prune. This property suggests broader challenges with the underlying pruning heuristics, the desire to prune at initialization, or both.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective functions that take a long time (min-utes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.},

But how important are the weight parameters of a neural network compared to its architecture? In this work, we question to what extent neural network architectures alone, without learning any weight parameters, can encode solutions for a given task. We propose a search method for neural network architectures that can already perform a task without any explicit weight training. To evaluate these networks, we populate the connections with a single shared weight parameter sampled from a uniform random distribution, and measure the expected performance. We demonstrate that our method can find minimal neural network architectures that can perform several reinforcement learning tasks without weight training. On a supervised learning domain, we find network architectures that achieve much higher than chance accuracy on MNIST using random weights.

Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are gaining momentum as a computationally feasible method for the automated optimisation of DNNs. Neuroevolution is a term which describes these processes of automated configuration and training of DNNs using EAs. However, the automatic design and/or training of these modern neural networks through evolutionary algorithms is computanalli expensive. Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution states that the majority of evolutionary changes at molecular level are the result of random fixation of selectively neutral mutations. A mutation from one gene to another is neutral if it does not affect the phenotype. This work discusses how neutrality, given certain conditions, can help to speed up the training/design of deep neural networks.},

In this paper, we propose a channel interaction network (CIN), which models the channel-wise interplay both within an image and across images. For a single image, a self-channel interaction (SCI) module is proposed to explore channel-wise correlation within the image. This allows the model to learn the complementary features from the correlated channels, yielding stronger fine-grained features. Furthermore, given an image pair, we introduce a contrastive channel interaction (CCI) module to model the cross-sample channel interaction with a metric learning framework, allowing the CIN to distinguish the subtle visual differences between images. Our model can be trained efficiently in an end-to-end fashion without the need of multi-stage training and testing. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available benchmarks, where the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-theart approaches, such as DFL-CNN (Wang, Morariu, and Davis 2018) and NTS (Yang et al. 2018).},

  abstract = {Overfitting and long training time are two fundamental challenges in multilayered neural network learning and deep learning in particular. Dropout and batch normalization are two well-recognized approaches to tackle these challenges. While both approaches share overlapping design principles, numerous research results have shown that they have unique strengths to improve deep learning. Many tools simplify these two approaches as a simple function call, allowing flexible stacking to form deep learning architectures. Although their usage guidelines are available, unfortunately no well-defined set of rules or comprehensive studies to investigate them concerning data input, network configurations, learning efficiency, and accuracy. It is not clear when users should consider using dropout and/or batch normalization, and how they should be combined (or used alternatively) to achieve optimized deep learning outcomes. In this paper we conduct an empirical study to investigate the effect of dropout and batch normalization on training deep learning models. We use multilayered dense neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as the deep learning models, and mix dropout and batch normalization to design different architectures and subsequently observe their performance in terms of training and test CPU time, number of parameters in the model (as a proxy for model size), and classification accuracy. The interplay between network structures, dropout, and batch normalization, allow us to conclude when and how dropout and batch normalization should be considered in deep learning. The empirical study quantified the increase in training time when dropout and batch normalization are used, as well as the increase in prediction time (important for constrained environments, such as smartphones and low-powered IoT devices). It showed that a non-adaptive optimizer (e.g. SGD) can outperform adaptive optimizers, but only at the cost of a significant amount of training times to perform hyperparameter tuning, while an adaptive optimizer (e.g. RMSProp) performs well without much tuning. Finally, it showed that dropout and batch normalization should be used in CNNs only with caution and experimentation (when in doubt and short on time to experiment, use only batch normalization).},

Using this property we show that stochastic gradient descent converges to a local minimum in a polynomial number of iterations. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that gives global convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent on non-convex functions with exponentially many local minima and saddle points. Our analysis can be applied to orthogonal tensor decomposition, which is widely used in learning a rich class of latent variable models. We propose a new optimization formulation for the tensor decomposition problem that has strict saddle property.

Our results demonstrate that successful model and hyperparameter choices allow the early optimization trajectory to either avoid---or navigate out of---regions of high curvature and into flatter regions that tolerate a higher learning rate. Our results suggest a unifying perspective on how disparate mitigation strategies for training instability ultimately address the same underlying failure mode of neural network optimization, namely poor conditioning. Inspired by the conditioning perspective, we show that learning rate warmup can improve training stability just as much as batch normalization, layer normalization, MetaInit, GradInit, and Fixup initialization.},

Through our analysis of gradient flow during training we attempt to answer: (1) why training unstructured sparse networks from random initialization performs poorly and; (2) what makes LTs and DST the exceptions? We show that sparse NNs have poor gradient flow at initialization and demonstrate the importance of using sparsity-aware initialization. Furthermore, we find that DST methods significantly improve gradient flow during training over traditional sparse training methods. Finally, we show that LTs do not improve gradient flow, rather their success lies in re-learning the pruning solution they are derived from - however, this comes at the cost of learning novel solutions.},

  doi = {10.1007/s10489-022-03293-x},
  abstract = {Due to the over-parameterization of neural networks, many model compression methods based on pruning and quantization have emerged. They are remarkable in reducing the size, parameter number, and computational complexity of the model. However, most of the models compressed by such methods need the support of special hardware and software, which increases the deployment cost. Moreover, these methods are mainly used in classification tasks, and rarely directly used in detection tasks. To address these issues, for the object detection network we introduce a three-stage model compression method: dynamic sparse training, group channel pruning, and spatial attention distilling. Firstly, to select out the unimportant channels in the network and maintain a good balance between sparsity and accuracy, we put forward a dynamic sparse training method, which introduces a variable sparse rate, and the sparse rate will change with the training process of the network. Secondly, to reduce the effect of pruning on network accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method called group channel pruning. In particular, we divide the network into multiple groups according to the scales of the feature layer and the similarity of module structure in the network, and then we use different pruning thresholds to prune the channels in each group. Finally, to recover the accuracy of the pruned network, we use an improved knowledge distillation method for the pruned network. Especially, we extract spatial attention information from the feature maps of specific scales in each group as knowledge for distillation. In the experiments, we use YOLOv4 as the object detection network and PASCAL VOC as the training dataset. Our method reduces the parameters of the model by 64.7  \%   and the calculation by 34.9  \%  . When the input image size is 416{\texttimes}416, compared with the original network model with 256MB size and 87.1 accuracies, our compressed model achieves 86.6 accuracies with 90MB size. To demonstrate the generality of our method, we replace the backbone to Darknet53 and Mobilenet and also achieve satisfactory compression results.},

  abstract = {Pruning neural networks has become popular in the last decade when it was shown that a large number of weights can be safely removed from modern neural networks without compromising accuracy. Numerous pruning methods have been proposed since then, each claiming to be better than the previous. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques today rely on complex pruning methodologies utilizing importance scores, getting feedback through back-propagation or having heuristics-based pruning rules amongst others. We question this pattern of introducing complexity in order to achieve better pruning results. We benchmark these SOTA techniques against Global Magnitude Pruning (Global MP), a naive pruning baseline, to evaluate whether complexity is really needed to achieve higher performance. Global MP ranks weights in order of their magnitudes and prunes the smallest ones. Hence, in its vanilla form, it is one of the simplest pruning techniques. Surprisingly, we find that vanilla Global MP outperforms all the other SOTA techniques and achieves a new SOTA result. It also achieves good performance on FLOPs sparsification, which we find is enhanced, when pruning is conducted in a gradual fashion. We also find that Global MP is generalizable across tasks, datasets and models with superior performance. Moreover, a common issue that many pruning algorithms run into at high sparsity rates, namely, layer-collapse, can be easily fixed in Global MP by setting a minimum threshold of weights to be retained in each layer. Lastly, unlike many other SOTA techniques, Global MP does not require any additional algorithm specific hyper-parameters and is very straightforward to tune and implement. We showcase our findings on various models (WRN-28-8, ResNet-32, ResNet-50, MobileNet-V1 and FastGRNN) and multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet and HAR-2). Code is available at https://github.com/manasgupta-1/GlobalMP.},

Unlike current RL based model compression approaches where feedback is given only at the end of each episode to the agent, PuRL provides rewards at every pruning step. This enables PuRL to achieve sparsity and accuracy comparable to current state-of-the-art methods, while having a much shorter training cycle. PuRL achieves more than 80\% sparsity on the ResNet-50 model while retaining a Top-1 accuracy of 75.37\% on the ImageNet dataset. Through our experiments we show that PuRL is also able to sparsify already efficient architectures like MobileNet-V2. In addition to performance characterisation experiments, we also provide a discussion and analysis of the various RL design choices that went into the tuning of the Markov Decision Process underlying PuRL. Lastly, we point out that PuRL is simple to use and can be easily adapted for various architectures.},

A simple argument then suggests that gradient descent may happen mostly in this subspace.

  abstract = {One of the major challenges in deploying deep neural network architectures is their size which has an adverse effect on their inference time and memory requirements. Deep CNNs can either be pruned width-wise by removing filters based on their importance or depth-wise by removing layers and blocks. Width wise pruning (filter pruning) is commonly performed via learnable gates or switches and sparsity regularizers whereas pruning of layers has so far been performed arbitrarily by manually designing a smaller network usually referred to as a student network. We propose a comprehensive pruning strategy that can perform both width-wise as well as depth-wise pruning. This is achieved by introducing gates at different granularities (neuron, filter, layer, block) which are then controlled via an objective function that simultaneously performs pruning at different granularity during each forward pass. Our approach is applicable to wide-variety of architectures without any constraints on spatial dimensions or connection type (sequential, residual, parallel or inception). Our method has resulted in a compression ratio of 70\% to 90\% without noticeable loss in accuracy when evaluated on benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources. To address this limitation, we introduce "deep compression", a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35x, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49x from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of complex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and download bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU, compressed network has 3x to 4x layerwise speedup and 3x to 7x better energy efficiency.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in video game AI, where the agents are located in a spatial grid-world environment and the number of agents varies both within and across episodes. The challenge is to flexibly control an arbitrary number of agents while achieving effective collaboration. Existing MARL methods usually suffer from the trade-off between these two considerations. To address the issue, we propose a novel architecture that learns a spatial joint representation of all the agents and outputs grid-wise actions. Each agent will be controlled independently by taking the action from the grid it occupies. By viewing the state information as a grid feature map, we employ a convolutional encoder-decoder as the policy network. This architecture naturally promotes agent communication because of the large receptive field provided by the stacked convolutional layers. Moreover, the spatially shared convolutional parameters enable fast parallel exploration that the experiences discovered by one agent can be immediately transferred to others. The proposed method can be conveniently integrated with general reinforcement learning algorithms, e.g., PPO and Q-leaming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in extensive challenging multi-agent tasks in StarCraft II.}

Thanks to its strong representation capabilities, researchers are looking at ways to apply transformer to computer vision tasks. In a variety of visual benchmarks, transformer-based models perform similar to or better than other types of networks such as convolutional and recurrent networks. Given its high performance and no need for human-defined inductive bias, transformer is receiving more and more attention from the computer vision community. In this paper, we review these visual transformer models by categorizing them in different tasks and analyzing their advantages and disadvantages. The main categories we explore include the backbone network, high/mid-level vision, low-level vision, and video processing. We also take a brief look at the self-attention mechanism in computer vision, as it is the base component in transformer. Furthermore, we include efficient transformer methods for pushing transformer into real device-based applications. Toward the end of this paper, we discuss the challenges and provide several further research directions for visual transformers.},

Does the brain use similar brute-force fitting processes to learn how to perceive and act upon the world? Recent advances in artificial neural networks have exposed the power of optimizing millions of synaptic weights over millions of observations to operate robustly in real-world contexts. These models do not learn simple, human-interpretable rules or representations of the world; rather, they use local computations to interpolate over task-relevant manifolds in a high-dimensional parameter space. Counterintuitively, similar to evolutionary processes, over-parameterized models can be simple and parsimonious, as they provide a versatile, robust solution for learning a diverse set of functions. This new family of direct-fit models present a radical challenge to many of the theoretical assumptions in psychology and neuroscience. At the same time, this shift in perspective establishes unexpected links with developmental and ecological psychology.},

In this paper, we analyze this norm-based criterion and point out that its effectiveness depends on two requirements that are not always met: (1) the norm deviation of the filters should be large; (2) the minimum norm of the filters should be small. To solve this problem, we propose a novel filter pruning method, namely Filter Pruning via Geometric Median (FPGM), to compress the model regardless of those two requirements. Unlike previous methods, FPGM compresses CNN models by pruning filters with redundancy, rather than those with``relatively less'' importance. When applied to two image classification benchmarks, our method validates its usefulness and strengths. Notably, on CIFAR-10, FPGM reduces more than 52\% FLOPs on ResNet-110 with even 2.69\% relative accuracy improvement. Moreover, on ILSVRC-2012, FPGM reduces more than 42\% FLOPs on ResNet-101 without top-5 accuracy drop, which has advanced the state-of-the-art.

  abstract = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in solving challenging problems across various domains using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Reproducing existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by novel methods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about how to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort stemming from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.},

We find that using larger models and artificial data augmentations can improve robustness on real-world distribution shifts, contrary to claims in prior work. We find improvements in artificial robustness benchmarks can transfer to real-world distribution shifts, contrary to claims in prior work. Motivated by our observation that data augmentations can help with real-world distribution shifts, we also introduce a new data augmentation method which advances the state-of-the-art and outperforms models pretrained with 1000 times more labeled data. Overall we find that some methods consistently help with distribution shifts in texture and local image statistics, but these methods do not help with some other distribution shifts like geographic changes. Our results show that future research must study multiple distribution shifts simultaneously, as we demonstrate that no evaluated method consistently improves robustness.},

  abstract = {Understanding the loss surfaces of neural networks is fundamentally important to understanding deep learning. This paper presents how the nonlinearities in activations substantially shape the loss surfaces of neural networks. We first prove that the loss surface of every neural network has infinite spurious local minima, which are defined as the local minima with higher empirical risks than the global minima. Our result holds for any neural network with arbitrary depth and arbitrary piecewise linear activation functions (excluding linear functions) under most loss functions in practice. This result demonstrates that nonlinear networks possess substantial differences to the well-studied linear neural networks. Essentially, the underlying assumptions for the above result are consistent with most practical circumstances where the output layer is narrower than any hidden layer. We further prove a theorem that draws a big picture for the loss surfaces of nonlinear neural networks from the following respects. (1) Smooth and multilinear partition: the loss surface is partitioned into multiple smooth and multilinear open cells. (2) Local analogous convexity: within every cell, local minima are equally good, and equivalently, they are all global minima in the cell. (3) Local minima valley: some local minima are concentrated into a valley in some cell, sharing the same empirical risk. (4) Linear collapse: when all activations are linear, the partitioned loss surface collapses to one single cell, which includes linear neural networks as a simplified case. The second result holds for one-hidden-layer networks for regression under convex loss, while all others apply to networks of arbitrary depth.},

  abstract = {Three factors drive the advance of AI: algorithmic innovation, data, and the amount of compute available for training. Algorithmic progress has traditionally been more difficult to quantify than compute and data. In this work, we argue that algorithmic progress has an aspect that is both straightforward to measure and interesting: reductions over time in the compute needed to reach past capabilities. We show that the number of floating-point operations required to train a classifier to AlexNet-level performance on ImageNet has decreased by a factor of 44x between 2012 and 2019. This corresponds to algorithmic efficiency doubling every 16 months over a period of 7 years. By contrast, Moore's Law would only have yielded an 11x cost improvement. We observe that hardware and algorithmic efficiency gains multiply and can be on a similar scale over meaningful horizons, which suggests that a good model of AI progress should integrate measures from both.},

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow de- ployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators [1] have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much eas- ier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full mod- els confuse.

  abstract = {We present a new algorithm for finding low-complexity neural networks with high generalization capability. The algorithm searches for a ``flat'' minimum of the error function. A flat minimum is a large connected region in weight space where the error remains approximately constant. An MDL-based, Bayesian argument suggests that flat minima correspond to ``simple'' networks and low expected overfitting. The argument is based on a Gibbs algorithm variant and a novel way of splitting generalization error into underfitting and overfitting error. Unlike many previous approaches, ours does not require gaussian assumptions and does not depend on a ``good'' weight prior. Instead we have a prior over input output functions, thus taking into account net architecture and training set. Although our algorithm requires the computation of second-order derivatives, it has backpropagation's order of complexity. Automatically, it effectively prunes units, weights, and input lines. Various experiments with feedforward and recurrent nets are described. In an application to stock market prediction, flat minimum search outperforms conventional backprop, weight decay, and ``optimal brain surgeon/optimal brain damage.''},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Are modern deep neural networks modular? How can this be quantified? In this paper, we consider the problem of assessing the modularity exhibited by a partitioning of a network's neurons. We propose two proxies for this: importance, which reflects how crucial sets of neurons are to network performance; and coherence, which reflects how consistently their neurons associate with features of the inputs. To measure these proxies, we develop a set of statistical methods based on techniques conventionally used to interpret individual neurons. We apply the proxies to partitionings generated by spectrally clustering a graph representation of the network's neurons with edges determined either by network weights or correlations of activations. We show that these partitionings, even ones based only on weights (i.e. strictly from non-runtime analysis), reveal groups of neurons that are important and coherent. These results suggest that graph-based partitioning can reveal modularity and help us understand how deep neural networks function.},

Similarly to their biological counterparts, sparse networks generalize just as well, sometimes even better than, the original dense networks. Sparsity promises to reduce the memory footprint of regular networks to fit mobile devices, as well as shorten training time for ever growing networks. In this paper, we survey prior work on sparsity in deep learning and provide an extensive tutorial of sparsification for both inference and training. We describe approaches to remove and add elements of neural networks, different training strategies to achieve model sparsity, and mechanisms to exploit sparsity in practice. Our work distills ideas from more than 300 research papers and provides guidance to practitioners who wish to utilize sparsity today, as well as to researchers whose goal is to push the frontier forward. We include the necessary background on mathematical methods in sparsification, describe phenomena such as early structure adaptation, the intricate relations between sparsity and the training process, and show techniques for achieving acceleration on real hardware. We also define a metric of pruned parameter efficiency that could serve as a baseline for comparison of different sparse networks. We close by speculating on how sparsity can improve future workloads and outline major open problems in the field.},

In many cases, increasing model capacity beyond the memory limit of a single accelerator has required developing special algorithms or infrastructure. These solutions are often architecture-specific and do not transfer to other tasks. To address the need for efficient and task-independent model parallelism, we introduce GPipe, a pipeline parallelism library that allows scaling any network that can be expressed as a sequence of layers. By pipelining different sub-sequences of layers on separate accelerators, GPipe provides the flexibility of scaling a variety of different networks to gigantic sizes efficiently. Moreover, GPipe utilizes a novel batch-splitting pipelining algorithm, resulting in almost linear speedup when a model is partitioned across multiple accelerators. We demonstrate the advantages of GPipe by training large-scale neural networks on two different tasks with distinct network architectures: (i) Image Classification: We train a 557-million-parameter AmoebaNet model and attain a top-1 accuracy of 84.4\% on ImageNet-2012, (ii) Multilingual Neural Machine Translation: We train a single 6-billion-parameter, 128-layer Transformer model on a corpus spanning over 100 languages and achieve better quality than all bilingual models.},

Empirical and theoretical results clearly indicate that the DNN training process itself implicitly implements a form of Self-Regularization, implicitly sculpting a more regularized energy or penalty landscape.  In particular, the empirical spectral density (ESD) of DNN layer matrices displays signatures of traditionally-regularized statistical models, even in the absence of exogenously specifying traditional forms of explicit regularization, such as Dropout or Weight Norm constraints.  Building on relatively recent results in RMT, most notably its extension to Universality classes of Heavy-Tailed matrices, and applying them to these empirical results, we develop a theory to identify 5+1 Phases of Training, corresponding to increasing amounts of Implicit Self-Regularization.  These phases can be observed during the training process as well as in the final learned DNNs.  For smaller and/or older DNNs, this Implicit Self-Regularization is like traditional Tikhonov regularization, in that there is a "size scale" separating signal from noise.  For state-of-the-art DNNs, however, we identify a novel form of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, similar to the self-organization seen in the statistical physics of disordered systems (such as classical models of actual neural activity).  This results from correlations arising at all size scales, which for DNNs arises implicitly due to the training process itself.  This implicit Self-Regularization can depend strongly on the many knobs of the training process.  In particular, we demonstrate that we can cause a small model to exhibit all 5+1 phases of training simply by changing the batch size.  Our results suggest that large, well-trained DNN architectures should exhibit Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, and we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this.},

We address this problem by designing a new value function with a contracting Bellman backup, where the super-zero level set, i.e., the set of states where the value function is evaluated to be non-negative, recovers the reach-avoid set. Building upon this, we prove that the proposed method can be adapted to compute the viability kernel, or the set of states which could be controlled to satisfy given constraints, and the backward reachable set, or the set of states that could be driven towards a given target set. Finally, we propose to alleviate the curse of dimensionality issue in high-dimensional problems by extending Conservative Q-Learning, a deep reinforcement learning technique, to learn a value function such that the super-zero level set of the learned value function serves as a (conservative) approximation to the reach-avoid set. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that the proposed method could learn reliably the reach-avoid set and the optimal control policy even with neural network approximation.},

During this event Dr. Khalsa discusses how interoception is critical for understanding how crosstalk between the body and brain influences mental health.    ~    The slides for this event can be found   here  .    ~      Series programme:        24  th   October, 4 pm BST / 3 pm GMT - `  Interoception and mental health: integrating mind body and brain interactions  ' with Dr Sahib Khalsa, University of Tulsa      ~      24  th   October, 6 pm BST / 5 pm GMT {\textendash} `  The brain-body axis in neurodevelopmental conditions  '   with Dr Eleanor Palser, University of California, San Francisco~      ~      27  th   October, 4 pm BST / 3 pm GMT {\textendash} `  How the brain processes gut feelings  '   with Dr Ryan Smith, University of Tulsa      ~      28  th   October, 3 pm BST / 2 pm GMT {\textendash} `  Heartbeats Influence Perception and Motor Activity'   with Dr Esra AI,~Columbia University      ~      If you'd like to present at your own Researcher Live event, please email   kristine.lennie@researcher-app.com            Date and Time    Monday, October 24, 2022  04:00 pm BST/ 03:00 pm GMT          Speakers        Dr Sahib Khalsa    Dr. Khalsa graduated from the Medical Scientist Training Program at the University of Iowa, receiving M.D. and Ph.D. (neuroscience) degrees.

Although benefits of depth have been investigated from different perspectives such as the approximation theory and the statistical learning theory, existing theories do not adequately explain the empirical success of overparameterized DNNs. In this work, we report a remarkable interplay between depth and locality of a target function. We introduce -local and -global functions, and find that depth is beneficial for learning local functions but detrimental to learning global functions. This interplay is not properly captured by the neural tangent kernel, which describes an infinitely wide neural network within the lazy learning regime.},

We also show that this Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) procedure finds much flatter solutions than SGD, and approximates the recent Fast Geometric Ensembling (FGE) approach with a single model. Using SWA we achieve notable improvement in test accuracy over conventional SGD training on a range of state-of-the-art residual networks, PyramidNets, DenseNets, and Shake-Shake networks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. In short, SWA is extremely easy to implement, improves generalization, and has almost no computational overhead.},

Their applications to some real world problems has been adopted by the lack of a training algorithm. This algorithms finds a nearly globally optimal set of weights in a relatively short time. Back propagation is one of the training algorithm of the Artificial neural network. However, training the neural networks using backpropagation algorithm may cause two main drawbacks: trapping into local minima and converging slowly. In view of these limitations of back-propagation neural networks, global search technique such as Genetic algorithm have been presented to overcome these shortcomings. Genetic algorithms are a class of optimization procedures which are good at exploring a large and complex space in an intelligent way. It finds values close to the global optimum. Hence, they are well suited to the problem of training and optimize weights of Artificial Neural Networks. In this paper the use of Genetic algorithms to optimize weights of Artificial Neural Networks is shown.},

In this work we present {\textbackslash}emph\{Population Based Training (PBT)\}, a simple asynchronous optimisation algorithm which effectively utilises a fixed computational budget to jointly optimise a population of models and their hyperparameters to maximise performance. Importantly, PBT discovers a schedule of hyperparameter settings rather than following the generally sub-optimal strategy of trying to find a single fixed set to use for the whole course of training. With just a small modification to a typical distributed hyperparameter training framework, our method allows robust and reliable training of models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PBT on deep reinforcement learning problems, showing faster wall-clock convergence and higher final performance of agents by optimising over a suite of hyperparameters. In addition, we show the same method can be applied to supervised learning for machine translation, where PBT is used to maximise the BLEU score directly, and also to training of Generative Adversarial Networks to maximise the Inception score of generated images. In all cases PBT results in the automatic discovery of hyperparameter schedules and model selection which results in stable training and better final performance.},

These priors introduce helpful inductive biases, but also lock models to individual modalities. In this paper we introduce the Perceiver - a model that builds upon Transformers and hence makes few architectural assumptions about the relationship between its inputs, but that also scales to hundreds of thousands of inputs, like ConvNets. The model leverages an asymmetric attention mechanism to iteratively distill inputs into a tight latent bottleneck, allowing it to scale to handle very large inputs. We show that this architecture is competitive with or outperforms strong, specialized models on classification tasks across various modalities: images, point clouds, audio, video, and video+audio. The Perceiver obtains performance comparable to ResNet-50 and ViT on ImageNet without 2D convolutions by directly attending to 50,000 pixels. It is also competitive in all modalities in AudioSet.},

  abstract = {Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) based training of neural networks with a large learning rate or a small batch-size typically ends in well-generalizing, flat regions of the weight space, as indicated by small eigenvalues of the Hessian of the training loss. However, the curvature along the SGD trajectory is poorly understood. An empirical investigation shows that initially SGD visits increasingly sharp regions, reaching a maximum sharpness determined by both the learning rate and the batch-size of SGD. When studying the SGD dynamics in relation to the sharpest directions in this initial phase, we find that the SGD step is large compared to the curvature and commonly fails to minimize the loss along the sharpest directions. Furthermore, using a reduced learning rate along these directions can improve training speed while leading to both sharper and better generalizing solutions compared to vanilla SGD. In summary, our analysis of the dynamics of SGD in the subspace of the sharpest directions shows that they influence the regions that SGD steers to (where larger learning rate or smaller batch size result in wider regions visited), the overall training speed, and the generalization ability of the final model.},

The convergence rate of this procedure matches the well-known convergence rate of gradient descent to first-order stationary points, up to log factors. When all saddle points are non-degenerate, all second-order stationary points are local minima, and our result thus shows that perturbed gradient descent can escape saddle points almost for free. Our results can be directly applied to many machine learning applications, including deep learning. As a particular concrete example of such an application, we show that our results can be used directly to establish sharp global convergence rates for matrix factorization. Our results rely on a novel characterization of the geometry around saddle points, which may be of independent interest to the non-convex optimization community.},

Since various integration methods with different purposes have been developed, there is a need to review the recent advances in using machine learning techniques to improve meta-heuristics. To the best of our knowledge, the literature is deprived of having a comprehensive yet technical review. To fill this gap, this paper provides such a review on the use of machine learning techniques in the design of different elements of meta-heuristics for different purposes including algorithm selection, fitness evaluation, initialization, evolution, parameter setting, and cooperation. First, we describe the key concepts and preliminaries of each of these ways of integration. Then, the recent advances in each way of integration are reviewed and classified based on a proposed unified taxonomy. Finally, we provide a technical discussion on the advantages, limitations, requirements, and challenges of implementing each of these integration ways, followed by promising future research directions.},

With no unrealistic assumption, we first prove the following statements for the squared loss function of deep linear neural networks with any depth and any widths: 1) the function is non-convex and non-concave, 2) every local minimum is a global minimum, 3) every critical point that is not a global minimum is a saddle point, and 4) there exist "bad" saddle points (where the Hessian has no negative eigenvalue) for the deeper networks (with more than three layers), whereas there is no bad saddle point for the shallow networks (with three layers). Moreover, for deep nonlinear neural networks, we prove the same four statements via a reduction to a deep linear model under the independence assumption adopted from recent work. As a result, we present an instance, for which we can answer the following question: how difficult is it to directly train a deep model in theory? It is more difficult than the classical machine learning models (because of the non-convexity), but not too difficult (because of the nonexistence of poor local minima). Furthermore, the mathematically proven existence of bad saddle points for deeper models would suggest a possible open problem. We note that even though we have advanced the theoretical foundations of deep learning and non-convex optimization, there is still a gap between theory and practice.},

However, while this direction of research has had some success, focusing on initialization alone appears to be inadequate. In this paper, we take a broader view of training sparse networks and consider the role of regularization, optimization, and architecture choices on sparse models. We propose a simple experimental framework, Same Capacity Sparse vs Dense Comparison (SC-SDC), that allows for a fair comparison of sparse and dense networks. Furthermore, we propose a new measure of gradient flow, Effective Gradient Flow (EGF), that better correlates to performance in sparse networks. Using top-line metrics, SC-SDC and EGF, we show that default choices of optimizers, activation functions and regularizers used for dense networks can disadvantage sparse networks. Based upon these findings, we show that gradient flow in sparse networks can be improved by reconsidering aspects of the architecture design and the training regime. Our work suggests that initialization is only one piece of the puzzle and taking a wider view of tailoring optimization to sparse networks yields promising results.},

It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions - and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation. We discuss several strategies to attempt to help large-batch methods eliminate this generalization gap.},

  abstract = {Neural networks can implement arbitrary functions. But, mechanistically, what are the tools at their disposal to construct the target? For classification tasks, the network must transform the data classes into a linearly separable representation in the final hidden layer. We show that a feed-forward architecture has one primary tool at hand to achieve this separability: progressive folding of the data manifold in unoccupied higher dimensions. The operation of folding provides a useful intuition in low-dimensions that generalizes to high ones. We argue that an alternative method based on shear, requiring very deep architectures, plays only a small role in real-world networks. The folding operation, however, is powerful as long as layers are wider than the data dimensionality, allowing efficient solutions by providing access to arbitrary regions in the distribution, such as data points of one class forming islands within the other classes. We argue that a link exists between the universal approximation property in ReLU networks and the fold-and-cut theorem (Demaine et al., 1998) dealing with physical paper folding. Based on the mechanistic insight, we predict that the progressive generation of separability is necessarily accompanied by neurons showing mixed selectivity and bimodal tuning curves. This is validated in a network trained on the poker hand task, showing the emergence of bimodal tuning curves during training. We hope that our intuitive picture of the data transformation in deep networks can help to provide interpretability, and discuss possible applications to the theory of convolutional networks, loss landscapes, and generalization. TL;DR: Shows that the internal processing of deep networks can be thought of as literal folding operations on the data distribution in the N-dimensional activation space. A link to a well-known theorem in origami theory is provided.},

  abstract = {The design of good heuristics or approximation algorithms for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems often requires significant specialized knowledge and trial-and-error. Can we automate this challenging, tedious process, and learn the algorithms instead? In many real-world applications, it is typically the case that the same optimization problem is solved again and again on a regular basis, maintaining the same problem structure but differing in the data. This provides an opportunity for learning heuristic algorithms that exploit the structure of such recurring problems.  In this paper, we propose a unique combination of reinforcement learning and graph embedding to address this challenge. The learned greedy policy behaves like a meta-algorithm that incrementally constructs a solution, and the action is determined by the output of a graph embedding network capturing the current state of the solution. We show that our framework can be applied to a diverse range of optimization problems over graphs, and learns effective algorithms for the Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Cut and Traveling Salesman problems.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks have been used in various fields, but their internal behavior in how they understand images is not well known. In this study, we discuss two counterintuitive properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). First, we evaluated the size of the receptive field of CNNs with their classification accuracy. Previous studies have attempted to increase the size of the receptive field for performance gain. However, we observed that some CNNs with a smaller receptive field can achieve higher classification accuracy. In this regard, we claim that a larger receptive field does not guarantee improved classification accuracy. Second, using the effective receptive field, we examined the contribution of each pixel to the output of CNN. Intuitively, each pixel is expected to equally contribute to the final output, but we found that there exist pixels in a partially dead state with little contribution to the output. We reveal that the reason for dead pixels lies in even stride operations with odd-sized kernels in CNN and propose a kernel padding method to remove the dead pixels. We demonstrated the vulnerability of CNNs with dead pixels when we detect a noise or small box that is on dead pixels. Our findings on dead pixels should be understood and considered in practical applications of CNN.},

  abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

However, the algorithms optimizing neural network parameters remain largely hand-designed and computationally inefficient. We study if we can use deep learning to directly predict these parameters by exploiting the past knowledge of training other networks. We introduce a large-scale dataset of diverse computational graphs of neural architectures - DeepNets-1M - and use it to explore parameter prediction on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. By leveraging advances in graph neural networks, we propose a hypernetwork that can predict performant parameters in a single forward pass taking a fraction of a second, even on a CPU. The proposed model achieves surprisingly good performance on unseen and diverse networks. For example, it is able to predict all 24 million parameters of a ResNet-50 achieving a 60\% accuracy on CIFAR-10. On ImageNet, top-5 accuracy of some of our networks approaches 50\%. Our task along with the model and results can potentially lead to a new, more computationally efficient paradigm of training networks. Our model also learns a strong representation of neural architectures enabling their analysis.},

We introduce a similarity index that measures the relationship between representational similarity matrices and does not suffer from this limitation. This similarity index is equivalent to centered kernel alignment (CKA) and is also closely connected to CCA. Unlike CCA, CKA can reliably identify correspondences between representations in networks trained from different initializations.},

  abstract = {Pre-trained Transformer-based language models have become a key building block for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. While these models are extremely accurate, they can be too large and computationally intensive to run on standard deployments. A variety of compression methods, including distillation, quantization, structured and unstructured pruning are known to be applicable to decrease model size and increase inference speed. In this context, this paper's contributions are two-fold. We begin with an in-depth study of the accuracy-compression trade-off for unstructured weight pruning in the context of BERT models, and introduce Optimal BERT Surgeon (O-BERT-S), an efficient and accurate weight pruning method based on approximate second-order information, which we show to yield state-of-the-art results in terms of the compression/accuracy trade-off. Specifically, Optimal BERT Surgeon extends existing work on second-order pruning by allowing for pruning blocks of weights, and by being applicable at BERT scale. Second, we investigate the impact of this pruning method when compounding compression approaches for Transformer-based models, which allows us to combine state-of-the-art structured and unstructured pruning together with quantization, in order to obtain highly compressed, but accurate models. The resulting compression framework is powerful, yet general and efficient: we apply it to both the fine-tuning and pre-training stages of language tasks, to obtain state-of-the-art results on the accuracy-compression trade-off with relatively simple compression recipes. For example, we obtain 10x model size compression with {$<$} 1\% relative drop in accuracy to the dense BERT-base, 10x end-to-end CPU-inference speedup with {$<$} 2\% relative drop in accuracy, and 29x inference speedups with {$<$} 7.5\% relative accuracy drop.},

On the accuracy side, we observe that standard loss-based fine-tuning may fail to recover accuracy, especially at high sparsities. To address this, we perform a detailed study of distillation-type losses, determining an L2-based distillation approach we term SquareHead which enables accurate recovery even at higher sparsities, across all model types. On the practical efficiency side, we show that sparse LLMs can be executed with speedups by taking advantage of sparsity, for both CPU and GPU runtimes. While the standard approach is to leverage sparsity for computational reduction, we observe that in the case of memory-bound LLMs sparsity can also be leveraged for reducing memory bandwidth. We exhibit end-to-end results showing speedups due to sparsity, while recovering accuracy, on T5 (language translation), Whisper (speech translation), and open GPT-type (MPT for text generation). For MPT text generation, we show for the first time that sparse fine-tuning can reach 75\% sparsity without accuracy drops, provide notable end-to-end speedups for both CPU and GPU inference, and highlight that sparsity is also compatible with quantization approaches.

  abstract = {Recent discoveries on neural network pruning reveal that, with a carefully chosen layerwise sparsity, a simple magnitude-based pruning achieves state-of-the-art tradeoff between sparsity and performance. However, without a clear consensus on ``how to choose,'' the layerwise sparsities are mostly selected algorithm-by-algorithm, often resorting to handcrafted heuristics or an extensive hyperparameter search. To fill this gap, we propose a novel importance score for global pruning, coined layer-adaptive magnitude-based pruning (LAMP) score; the score is a rescaled version of weight magnitude that incorporates the model-level \${\textbackslash}ell\_2\$ distortion incurred by pruning, and does not require any hyperparameter tuning or heavy computation. Under various image classification setups, LAMP consistently outperforms popular existing schemes for layerwise sparsity selection. Furthermore, we observe that LAMP continues to outperform baselines even in weight-rewinding setups, while the connectivity-oriented layerwise sparsity (the strongest baseline overall) performs worse than a simple global magnitude-based pruning in this case.

  abstract = {The predominant methodology in training deep learning advocates the use of stochastic gradient descent methods (SGDs). Despite its ease of implementation, SGDs are difficult to tune and parallelize. These problems make it challenging to develop, debug and scale up deep learning algorithms with SGDs. In this paper, we show that more sophisticated off-the-shelf optimization methods such as Limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) and Conjugate gradient (CG) with line search can significantly simplify and speed up the process of pretraining deep algorithms. In our experiments, the difference between L-BFGS/CG and SGDs are more pronounced if we consider algorithmic extensions (e.g., sparsity regularization) and hardware extensions (e.g., GPUs or computer clusters). Our experiments with distributed optimization support the use of L-BFGS with locally connected networks and convolutional neural networks. Using L-BFGS, our convolutional network model achieves 0.69\% on the standard MNIST dataset. This is a state-of-the-art result on MNIST among algorithms that do not use distortions or pretraining.

  abstract = {Combinatorial features are essential for the success of many commercial models. Manually crafting these features usually comes with high cost due to the variety, volume and velocity of raw data in web-scale systems. Factorization based models, which measure interactions in terms of vector product, can learn patterns of combinatorial features automatically and generalize to unseen features as well. With the great success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various fields, recently researchers have proposed several DNN-based factorization model to learn both low- and high-order feature interactions. Despite the powerful ability of learning an arbitrary function from data, plain DNNs generate feature interactions implicitly and at the bit-wise level. In this paper, we propose a novel Compressed Interaction Network (CIN), which aims to generate feature interactions in an explicit fashion and at the vector-wise level. We show that the CIN share some functionalities with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We further combine a CIN and a classical DNN into one unified model, and named this new model eXtreme Deep Factorization Machine (xDeepFM). On one hand, the xDeepFM is able to learn certain bounded-degree feature interactions explicitly; on the other hand, it can learn arbitrary low- and high-order feature interactions implicitly. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that xDeepFM outperforms state-of-the-art models. We have released the source code of xDeepFM at {\textbackslash}url\{https://github.com/Leavingseason/xDeepFM\}.},

  abstract = {Network pruning has been the driving force for the acceleration of neural networks and the alleviation of model storage/transmission burden. With the advent of AutoML and neural architecture search (NAS), pruning has become topical with automatic mechanism and searching based architecture optimization. Yet, current automatic designs rely on either reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithm. Due to the non-differentiability of those algorithms, the pruning algorithm needs a long searching stage before reaching the convergence. To circumvent this problem, this paper introduces a differentiable pruning method via hypernetworks for automatic network pruning. The specifically designed hypernetworks take latent vectors as input and generate the weight parameters of the backbone network. The latent vectors control the output channels of the convolutional layers in the backbone network and act as a handle for the pruning of the layers. By enforcing \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ sparsity regularization to the latent vectors and utilizing proximal gradient solver, sparse latent vectors can be obtained. Passing the sparsified latent vectors through the hypernetworks, the corresponding slices of the generated weight parameters can be removed, achieving the effect of network pruning. The latent vectors of all the layers are pruned together, resulting in an automatic layer configuration. Extensive experiments are conducted on various networks for image classification, single image super-resolution, and denoising. And the experimental results validate the proposed method.},

By simply changing the way the sparsity regularization is enforced, filter pruning and low-rank decomposition can be derived accordingly. This provides another flexible choice for network compression because the techniques complement each other. For example, in popular network architectures with shortcut connections (e.g. ResNet), filter pruning cannot deal with the last convolutional layer in a ResBlock while the low-rank decomposition methods can. In addition, we propose to compress the whole network jointly instead of in a layer-wise manner. Our approach proves its potential as it compares favorably to the state-of-the-art on several benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Despite its popularity in the reinforcement learning community, a provably convergent policy gradient method for general continuous space-time stochastic control problems has been elusive. This paper closes the gap by proposing a proximal gradient algorithm for feedback controls of finite-time horizon stochastic control problems. The state dynamics are continuous time nonlinear diffusions with controlled drift and possibly degenerate noise, and the objectives are nonconvex in the state and nonsmooth in the control. We prove under suitable conditions that the algorithm converges linearly to a stationary point of the control problem, and is stable with respect to policy updates by approximate gradient steps. The convergence result justifies the recent reinforcement learning heuristics that adding entropy regularization to the optimization objective accelerates the convergence of policy gradient methods. The proof exploits careful regularity estimates of backward stochastic differential equations.},

Translating Embeddings is a knowledge graph completion approach which was recently adapted to a translation-based sequential recommendation (TransRec) method. We observe a flaw of TransRec when handling complex translations, which hinders it from generating accurate suggestions. In view of this, we propose a translation-based recommender for complex users (CTransRec), which utilizes category-specific projection and temporal dynamic relaxation. Using our proposed Margin-based Pairwise Bayesian Personalized Ranking and Time-Aware Negative Sampling, CTransRec outperforms state-of-the-art methods for sequential recommendation on extremely sparse data. The superiority of CTransRec, which is confirmed by our extensive experiments on both public data and real data obtained from the industry, comes from not only the additional information used in training but also the fact that CTransRec makes good use of this additional information to model the complex translations.},

Despite the success of ANNs, it is challenging to train and deploy modern ANNs on commodity hardware due to the ever-increasing model size and the unprecedented growth in the data volumes. Particularly for microarray data, the very-high dimensionality and the small number of samples make it difficult for machine learning techniques to handle. Furthermore, specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is expensive. Sparse neural networks are the leading approaches to address these challenges. However, off-the-shelf sparsity inducing techniques either operate from a pre-trained model or enforce the sparse structure via binary masks. The training efficiency of sparse neural networks cannot be obtained practically. In this paper, we introduce a technique allowing us to train truly sparse neural networks with fixed parameter count throughout training. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method can be applied directly to handle high dimensional data, while achieving higher accuracy than the traditional two phases approaches. Moreover, we have been able to create truly sparse MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs) models with over one million neurons and to train them on a typical laptop without GPU, this being way beyond what is possible with any state-of-the-art techniques.},

However, the reasons for these differences, and their effects on the underlying loss landscape, are not well understood. In this paper, we explore the structure of neural loss functions, and the effect of loss landscapes on generalization, using a range of visualization methods. First, we introduce a simple "filter normalization" method that helps us visualize loss function curvature and make meaningful side-by-side comparisons between loss functions.

Deep learning algorithms are promising techniques, which have been used in many classification problems.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based multi-agent system for intrusion detection which combines the desired features of multi-agent system approach with the precision of deep learning algorithms. Therefore, we created a number of autonomous, intelligent and adaptive agents that implanted three algorithms, namely autoencoder, multilayer perceptron and k-nearest neighbors. Autoencoder is used as features reduction tool, and multilayer perceptron and k-nearest neighbors are used as classifiers. The performance of our model is compared against traditional machine learning approaches and other multi-agent system-based systems. The experiments have shown that our hybrid distributed intrusion detection system achieves the detection with better accuracy rate and it reduces considerably the time of detection.},

  abstract = {Recent network pruning methods focus on pruning models early-on in training. To estimate the impact of removing a parameter, these methods use importance measures that were originally designed to prune trained models. Despite lacking justification for their use early-on in training, such measures result in surprisingly low accuracy loss. To better explain this behavior, we develop a general framework that uses gradient flow to unify state-of-the-art importance measures through the norm of model parameters. We use this framework to determine the relationship between pruning measures and evolution of model parameters, establishing several results related to pruning models early-on in training: (i) magnitude-based pruning removes parameters that contribute least to reduction in loss, resulting in models that converge faster than magnitude-agnostic methods; (ii) loss-preservation based pruning preserves first-order model evolution dynamics and its use is therefore justified for pruning minimally trained models; and (iii) gradient-norm based pruning affects second-order model evolution dynamics, such that increasing gradient norm via pruning can produce poorly performing models. We validate our claims on several VGG-13, MobileNet-V1, and ResNet-56 models trained on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100.},

  abstract = {The generalization mystery of overparametrized deep nets has motivated efforts to understand how gradient descent (GD) converges to low-loss solutions that generalize well. Real-life neural networks are initialized from small random values and trained with cross-entropy loss for classification (unlike the "lazy" or "NTK" regime of training where analysis was more successful), and a recent sequence of results (Lyu and Li, 2020; Chizat and Bach, 2020; Ji and Telgarsky, 2020) provide theoretical evidence that GD may converge to the "max-margin" solution with zero loss, which presumably generalizes well. However, the global optimality of margin is proved only in some settings where neural nets are infinitely or exponentially wide. The current paper is able to establish this global optimality for two-layer Leaky ReLU nets trained with gradient flow on linearly separable and symmetric data, regardless of the width. The analysis also gives some theoretical justification for recent empirical findings (Kalimeris et al., 2019) on the so-called simplicity bias of GD towards linear or other "simple" classes of solutions, especially early in training. On the pessimistic side, the paper suggests that such results are fragile. A simple data manipulation can make gradient flow converge to a linear classifier with suboptimal margin.},

  abstract = {It is well known that utterances convey a great deal of information about the speaker in addition to their semantic content.  One such type of information consists of cues to the speaker's personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans.  Recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation, such as emotion, deception, speaker charisma, dominance, point of view, subjectivity, opinion and sentiment. Personality affects these other aspects of linguistic production, and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks, in addition to many other potential applications.  However, to date, there is little work on the automatic recognition of personality traits.  This article reports experimental results for recognition of all Big Five personality traits, in both conversation and text, utilising both self and observer ratings of personality.  While other work reports classification results, we experiment with classification, regression and ranking models. For each model, we analyse the effect of different feature sets on accuracy. Results show that for some traits, any type of statistical model performs significantly better than the baseline, but ranking models perform best overall. We also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are more accurate than multi-class classifiers for modelling personality. In addition, recognition models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using self-reports, and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait. A qualitative analysis of the learned models confirms previous findings linking language and personality, while revealing many new linguistic markers.},

  abstract = {The increasing adoption of technologies and the exponential growth of networks has made the area of information technology an integral part of our lives, where network security plays a vital role. One of the most serious threats in the current Internet is posed by distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which target the availability of the victim system. Such an attack is designed to exhaust a server's resources or congest a network's infrastructure, and therefore renders the victim incapable of providing services to its legitimate users or customers. To tackle the distributed nature of these attacks, a distributed and coordinated defence mechanism is necessary, where many defensive nodes, across different locations cooperate in order to stop or reduce the flood. This thesis investigates the applicability of distributed reinforcement learning to intrusion response, specifically, DDoS response. We propose a novel approach to respond to DDoS attacks called Multiagent Router Throttling. Multiagent Router Throttling provides an agent-based distributed response to the DDoS problem, where multiple reinforcement learning agents are installed on a set of routers and learn to rate-limit or throttle traffic towards a victim server. One of the novel characteristics of the proposed approach is that it has a decentralised architecture and provides a decentralised coordinated response to the DDoS problem, thus being resilient to the attacks themselves. Scalability constitutes a critical aspect of a defence system since a non-scalable mechanism will never be considered, let alone adopted, for wide deployment by a company or organisation. We propose Coordinated Team Learning (CTL) which is a novel design to the original Multiagent Router Throttling approach based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm, that uses task decomposition and coordinated team rewards. To better scale-up CTL is combined with a form of reward shaping. The scalability of the proposed system is successfully demonstrated in experiments involving up to 1000 reinforcement learning agents. The significant improvements on scalability and learning speed lay the foundations for a potential real-world deployment.},

However, their application to some realworld problems has been hampered by the lack of a training algonthm which reliably finds a nearly globally optimal set of weights in a relatively short time. Genetic algorithms are a class of optimization procedures which are good at exploring a large and complex space in an intelligent way to find values close to the global optimum. Hence, they are well suited to the problem of training feedforward networks. In this paper, we describe a set of experiments performed on data from a sonar image classification problem. These experiments both 1) illustrate the improvements gained by using a genetic algorithm rather than backpropagation and 2) chronicle the evolution of the performance of the genetic algorithm as we added more and more domain-specific knowledge into it.},

Here, we develop projection weighted CCA (Canonical Correlation Analysis) as a tool for understanding neural networks, building off of SVCCA, a recently proposed method (Raghu et al., 2017). We first improve the core method, showing how to differentiate between signal and noise, and then apply this technique to compare across a group of CNNs, demonstrating that networks which generalize converge to more similar representations than networks which memorize, that wider networks converge to more similar solutions than narrow networks, and that trained networks with identical topology but different learning rates converge to distinct clusters with diverse representations. We also investigate the representational dynamics of RNNs, across both training and sequential timesteps, finding that RNNs converge in a bottom-up pattern over the course of training and that the hidden state is highly variable over the course of a sequence, even when accounting for linear transforms. Together, these results provide new insights into the function of CNNs and RNNs, and demonstrate the utility of using CCA to understand representations.},

  abstract = {In deep learning it is common to overparameterize neural networks, that is, to use more parameters than training samples. Quite surprisingly training the neural network via (stochastic) gradient descent leads to models that generalize very well, while classical statistics would suggest overfitting. In order to gain understanding of this implicit bias phenomenon we study the special case of sparse recovery (compressed sensing) which is of interest on its own. More precisely, in order to reconstruct a vector from underdetermined linear measurements, we introduce a corresponding overparameterized square loss functional, where the vector to be reconstructed is deeply factorized into several vectors. We show that, if there exists an exact solution, vanilla gradient flow for the overparameterized loss functional converges to a good approximation of the solution of minimal -norm. The latter is well-known to promote sparse solutions. As a by-product, our results significantly improve the sample complexity for compressed sensing via gradient flow/descent on overparameterized models derived in previous works. The theory accurately predicts the recovery rate in numerical experiments. Our proof relies on a analyzing a certain Bregman divergence of the flow. This bypasses the obstacles caused by non-convexity and should be of independent interest.},

This study describes a meta-analysis that synthesizes 23 independent estimates of the correlations between the Big Five major personality traits, and some computationally obtained indicators from written language. The results show significant combined estimates of the correlations, albeit small to moderate according to Cohen's conventions to interpret effect sizes, for the five traits (between r~=~0.26 for agreeableness and neuroticism, and 0.30 for openness). These estimates are moderated by the type of information in the texts, the use of prediction mechanisms, and the source of publication of the primary studies. Generally, the same effective moderators operate for the five traits. It is concluded that written language analyzed through computational methods could be used to extract relevant information of personality.

Recently, techniques based on dynamic reallocation of non-zero parameters have emerged, allowing direct training of sparse networks without having to pre-train a large dense model. Here we present a novel dynamic sparse reparameterization method that addresses the limitations of previous techniques such as high computational cost and the need for manual configuration of the number of free parameters allocated to each layer. We evaluate the performance of dynamic reallocation methods in training deep convolutional networks and show that our method outperforms previous static and dynamic reparameterization methods, yielding the best accuracy for a fixed parameter budget, on par with accuracies obtained by iteratively pruning a pre-trained dense model. We further investigated the mechanisms underlying the superior generalization performance of the resultant sparse networks. We found that neither the structure, nor the initialization of the non-zero parameters were sufficient to explain the superior performance. Rather, effective learning crucially depended on the continuous exploration of the sparse network structure space during training. Our work suggests that exploring structural degrees of freedom during training is more effective than adding extra parameters to the network.},

In this paper, we investigate two techniques for group-wise pruning during training in order to improve network efficiency. We propose a gating factor after every convolutional layer to induce channel level sparsity, encouraging insignificant channels to become exactly zero. Further, we introduce and analyse a bounded variant of the L1 regularizer, which interpolates between L1 and L0-norms to retain performance of the network at higher pruning rates. To underline effectiveness of the proposed methods,we show that the number of parameters of ResNet-164, DenseNet-40 and MobileNetV2 can be reduced down by 30\%, 69\% and 75\% on CIFAR100 respectively without a significant drop in accuracy. We achieve state-of-the-art pruning results for ResNet-50 with higher accuracy on ImageNet.

Parameter interaction in non-separable problems is a major source of performance loss specially on large scale problems. Cooperative Co-evolution(CC) has been proposed as a natural solution for large scale optimization problems, but lack of a systematic way of decomposing large scale non-separable problems is a major obstacle for CC frameworks. The aim of this paper is to propose a systematic way of capturing interacting variables for a more effective problem decomposition suitable for cooperative co-evolutionary frameworks. Grouping interacting variables in different subcomponents in a CC framework imposes a limit to the extent interacting variables can be optimized to their optimum values, in other words it limits the improvement interval of interacting variables. This is the central idea of the newly proposed technique which is called delta method. Delta method measures the averaged difference in a certain variable across the entire population and uses it for identifying interacting variables. The experimental results show that this new technique is more effective than the existing random grouping method.},

In this paper, we propose a projected neural network modeled by a differential equation to solve a class of these optimization problems, in which the objective function is the sum of a nonsmooth convex loss function and the regularization defined by the\,  L0  -norm function. This optimization problem is not only nonconvex, but also discontinuous. To simplify the structure of the proposed network and let it own better convergence properties, we use the smoothing method, where the new constructed smoothing function for the regularization term plays a key role. We prove that the solution to the proposed network is globally existent and unique, and any accumulation point of it is a critical point of the continuous relaxation model. Except for a special case, which can be easily justified, any critical point is a local minimizer of the considered sparse optimization problem. It is an interesting thing that all critical points own a promising lower bound property, which is satisfied by all global minimizers of the considered problem, but is not by all local minimizers. Finally, we use some numerical experiments to illustrate the efficiency and good performance of the proposed method for solving this class of sparse optimization problems, which include the most widely used models in feature selection of classification learning.},

This paper presents a novel training scheme based on composite constraints that prune redundant filters and minimize their effect on overall network learning via sparsity promotion. Also, as opposed to prior works that employ pseudo-norm-based sparsity-inducing constraints, we propose a sparse scheme based on gradient counting in our framework. Our tests on several pixel-wise segmentation benchmarks show that the number of neurons and the memory footprint of networks in the test phase are significantly reduced without affecting performance. MobileNetV3 and UNet, two well-known architectures, are used to test the proposed scheme. Our network compression method not only results in reduced parameters but also achieves improved performance compared to MobileNetv3, which is an already optimized architecture.},

  abstract = {Model pruning is one of the main methods of deep neural network model compression. However, the existing model pruning methods are inefficient, there is still a lot of redundancy in the network, and the pruning has a great impact on the accuracy. In addition, the traditional pruning process usually needs to fine-tune the network to restore accuracy, and fine-tuning has a limited effect on accuracy recovery, so it is difficult to achieve a high level of accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new neural network pruning framework: the channel sparsity is realized by introducing a scale factor, and the sparse network is pruned by setting a global threshold, which greatly improves the efficiency of pruning. After pruning, this paper proposes a rewind method to restore the accuracy, that is, save the weight after training, and then reload it on the network for training to restore the accuracy. In addition, we also study the best rewind point of the three networks. The experimental results show that our method significantly reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs without affecting or even improving the accuracy, and the rewind method proposed by us achieves a better accuracy recovery effect than fine-tuning. At the same time, we find that the epoch with the highest accuracy is the best rewind point, and the accuracy is the highest after saving its corresponding weight and retraining the model.},

Moreover this calculus is entirely compatible with algorithmic differentiation (e.g., backpropagation). We provide several applications such as training deep equilibrium networks, training neural nets with conic optimization layers, or hyperparameter-tuning for nonsmooth Lasso-type models.

Despite significant effort and progress in this field, the existing prediction methods are either limited by the number of input variables or restricted to those financial predictors. To alleviate those issues, both financial variables and non-financial variables are screened out from the existing accounting and finance theory to use as financial distress predictors. In addition, a novel method for financial distress prediction (FDP) based on sparse neural networks is proposed, namely FDP-SNN, in which the weight of the hidden layer is constrained with   {\textbackslash}(L\_\{1/2\}{\textbackslash})   regularization to achieve the sparsity, so as to select relevant and important predictors, improving the predicted accuracy.

In so doing, the current study assesses the Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE) deep learning method when applied to the characterization of structural anomalies. The fundamental concept is to employ the SAE to extract significant features from monitored signals and the well-known Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify those features within the framework of a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) program. The proposed method is evaluated using vibration data from a numerical beam model and a highway viaduct in Brazil. The results demonstrate that the SAE can extract relevant properties from dynamic data, making it valuable for SHM applications.},

For practitioners, the library provides an easy-to-use unified interface to generate the explanations for their applications by only writing a few lines of codes, and also a GUI dashboard for visualization of different explanations for more insights about decisions.

However, the training memory consumption is prohibitive for IoT devices that have tiny memory resources. We propose an algorithm-system co-design framework to make on-device training possible with only 256KB of memory. On-device training faces two unique challenges: (1) the quantized graphs of neural networks are hard to optimize due to mixed bit-precision and the lack of normalization; (2) the limited hardware resource (memory and computation) does not allow full backward computation. To cope with the optimization difficulty, we propose Quantization-Aware Scaling to calibrate the gradient scales and stabilize quantized training. To reduce the memory footprint, we propose Sparse Update to skip the gradient computation of less important layers and sub-tensors. The algorithm innovation is implemented by a lightweight training system, Tiny Training Engine, which prunes the backward computation graph to support sparse updates and offloads the runtime auto-differentiation to compile time. Our framework is the first practical solution for on-device transfer learning of visual recognition on tiny IoT devices (e.g., a microcontroller with only 256KB SRAM), using less than 1/100 of the memory of existing frameworks while matching the accuracy of cloud training+edge deployment for the tinyML application VWW. Our study enables IoT devices to not only perform inference but also continuously adapt to new data for on-device lifelong learning.},

The model is fully probabilistic and autoregressive, with the predictive distribution for each audio sample conditioned on all previous ones; nonetheless we show that it can be efficiently trained on data with tens of thousands of samples per second of audio. When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.},

  abstract = {Skip connections made the training of very deep networks possible and have become an indispensable component in a variety of neural architectures. A completely satisfactory explanation for their success remains elusive. Here, we present a novel explanation for the benefits of skip connections in training very deep networks. The difficulty of training deep networks is partly due to the singularities caused by the non-identifiability of the model. Several such singularities have been identified in previous works: (i) overlap singularities caused by the permutation symmetry of nodes in a given layer, (ii) elimination singularities corresponding to the elimination, i.e. consistent deactivation, of nodes, (iii) singularities generated by the linear dependence of the nodes. These singularities cause degenerate manifolds in the loss landscape that slow down learning. We argue that skip connections eliminate these singularities by breaking the permutation symmetry of nodes, by reducing the possibility of node elimination and by making the nodes less linearly dependent. Moreover, for typical initializations, skip connections move the network away from the "ghosts" of these singularities and sculpt the landscape around them to alleviate the learning slow-down. These hypotheses are supported by evidence from simplified models, as well as from experiments with deep networks trained on real-world datasets.},

  journal = {arXiv Disordered Systems and Neural Networks},
  doi = {arXiv:2203.11355v1},
  abstract = {Neural networks can implement arbitrary functions. But, mechanistically, what are the tools at their disposal to construct the target? For classification tasks, the network must transform the data classes into a linearly separable representation in the final hidden layer. We show that a feed-forward architecture has one primary tool at hand to achieve this separability: progressive folding of the data manifold in unoccupied higher dimensions. The operation of folding provides a useful intuition in low-dimensions that generalizes to high ones. We argue that an alternative method based on shear, requiring very deep architectures, plays only a small role in real-world networks. The folding operation, however, is powerful as long as layers are wider than the data dimensionality, allowing efficient solutions by providing access to arbitrary regions in the distribution, such as data points of one class forming islands within the other classes. We argue that a link exists between the universal approximation property in ReLU networks and the fold-and-cut theorem (Demaine et al., 1998) dealing with physical paper folding. Based on the mechanistic insight, we predict that the progressive generation of separability is necessarily accompanied by neurons showing mixed selectivity and bimodal tuning curves. This is validated in a network trained on the poker hand task, showing the emergence of bimodal tuning curves during training. We hope that our intuitive picture of the data transformation in deep networks can help to provide interpretability, and discuss possible applications to the theory of convolutional networks, loss landscapes, and generalization.     TL;DR: Shows that the internal processing of deep networks can be thought of as literal folding operations on the data distribution in the N-dimensional activation space. A link to a well-known theorem in origami theory is provided.},

  abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the computing paradigm that has achieved remarkable success in various fields of engineering in recent years, primarily visual recognition. DNNs owe its success to the presence of large number of weight parameters (and increased depth), which led to huge computation and memory costs for implementation. These limiting factors hinder the scalability of such algorithms on resource constraint devices (like IoT devices). In general, DNNs are believed to be over parametrized i.e., the parameters are highly redundant, thus can be structurally removed without significant loss of performance. To solve these issues, we propose to use non-convex T\textsubscript{1} regularizer along with the additional effect of sparse group lasso to completely remove the redundant neurons/filters that is, to introduce structured sparsity. The network has been trained using the proximal gradient method, which is useful in optimizing functions with the combination of smooth and non-smooth terms. We show that proposed regularizer manages to achieve competitive performances as well as extremely compact networks. Detailed experiments are performed on several benchmark datasets that illustrate the efficiency of the approach. On the ImageNet dataset, our approach removes more than 50\% of parameters of convolutional layers and 85\% parameters of fully connected layers of Alexnet with no drop in accuracy.},

We show this term is not a Covariance but a second moment matrix, i.e., it is influenced by means of gradients. These means possess an additive two-way structure that is the source of the outliers in the spectrum. This structure can be used to approximate the principal subspace of the Hessian using certain "averaging" operations, avoiding the need for high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We corroborate this claim across different datasets, architectures and sample sizes.},

In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.},

  abstract = {Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.},

  abstract = {For the solution of the functional equation P (x) = 0 (1) (where P is an operator, usually linear, from B into B, and B is a Banach space) iteration methods are generally used. These consist of the construction of a series x0, {\ldots}, xn, {\ldots}, which converges to the solution (see, for example [1]). Continuous analogues of these methods are also known, in which a trajectory x(t), 0 {$\leqslant$} t {$\leqslant$} {$\infty$} is constructed, which satisfies the ordinary differential equation in B and is such that x(t) approaches the solution of (1) as t {\textrightarrow} {$\infty$} (see [2]). We shall call the method a k-step method if for the construction of each successive iteration xn+1 we use k previous iterations xn, {\ldots}, xn-k+1. The same term will also be used for continuous methods if x(t) satisfies a differential equation of the k-th order or k-th degree. Iteration methods which are more widely used are one-step (e.g. methods of successive approximations). They are generally simple from the calculation point of view but often converge very slowly. This is confirmed both by the evaluation of the speed of convergence and by calculation in practice (for more details see below). Therefore the question of the rate of convergence is most important. Some multistep methods, which we shall consider further, which are only slightly more complicated than the corresponding one-step methods, make it possible to speed up the convergence substantially. Note that all the methods mentioned below are applicable also to the problem of minimizing the differentiable functional (x) in Hilbert space, so long as this problem reduces to the solution of the equation grad (x) = 0.},

  abstract = {Deep neuroevolution and deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) algorithms are two popular approaches to policy search. The former is widely applicable and rather stable, but suffers from low sample efficiency. By contrast, the latter is more sample efficient, but the most sample efficient variants are also rather unstable and highly sensitive to hyper-parameter setting. So far, these families of methods have mostly been compared as competing tools. However, an emerging approach consists in combining them so as to get the best of both worlds. Two previously existing combinations use either an ad hoc evolutionary algorithm or a goal exploration process together with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, a sample efficient off-policy deep RL algorithm. In this paper, we propose a different combination scheme using the simple cross-entropy method (CEM) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (td3), another off-policy deep RL algorithm which improves over ddpg. We evaluate the resulting method, cem-rl, on a set of benchmarks classically used in deep RL. We show that cem-rl benefits from several advantages over its competitors and offers a satisfactory trade-off between performance and sample efficiency.},

  abstract = {Game Theory Through Examples is a thorough introduction to elementary game theory, covering finite games with complete information. The core philosophy underlying this volume is that abstract concepts are best learned when encountered first (and repeatedly) in concrete settings. Thus, the essential ideas of game theory are here presented in the context of actual games, real games much more complex and rich than the typical toy examples. All the fundamental ideas are here: Nash equilibria, backward induction, elementary probability, imperfect information, extensive and normal form, mixed and behavioral strategies. The active-learning, example-driven approach makes the text suitable for a course taught through problem solving. Students will be thoroughly engaged by the extensive classroom exercises, compelling homework problems and nearly sixty projects in the text. Also available are approximately eighty Java applets and three dozen Excel spreadsheets in which students can play games and organize information in order to acquire a gut feeling to help in the analysis of the games. Mathematical exploration is a deep form of play, that maxim is embodied in this book. Game Theory Through Examples is a lively introduction to this appealing theory. Assuming only high school prerequisites makes the volume especially suitable for a liberal arts or general education spirit-of-mathematics course. It could also serve as the active-learning supplement to a more abstract text in an upper-division game theory course.},

The main strength of this method is that it can prune both the redundant nodes between groups in the network, and also the redundant weights of the non-redundant nodes within the group, so as to achieve the sparseness of the network. Another strength is that the non-smooth absolute value function in the traditional   L1/2   regularization method is replaced by a smooth function. This reduces the oscillations of learning and enables us to more effectively prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

The first step is to train the network to optimize a performance index, which includes both the error in fitting the function and the error in fitting the derivatives. The second step is to prune the network by removing neurons that cause overfitting and then to retrain it. This paper describes two novel types of overfitting that are only observed when simultaneously fitting both a function and its first derivatives. A new pruning algorithm is proposed to eliminate these types of overfitting. Experimental results show that the pruning algorithm successfully eliminates the overfitting and produces the smoothest responses and the best generalization among all the training algorithms that we have tested.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning is about learning agent models that make the best sequential decisions in unknown environments. In an unknown environment, the agent needs to explore the environment while exploiting the collected information, which usually forms a sophisticated problem to solve. Derivative-free optimization, meanwhile, is capable of solving sophisticated problems. It commonly uses a sampling-and-updating framework to iteratively improve the solution, where exploration and exploitation are also needed to be well balanced. Therefore, derivative-free optimization deals with a similar core issue as reinforcement learning, and has been introduced in reinforcement learning approaches, under the names of learning classifier systems and neuroevolution/evolutionary reinforcement learning. Although such methods have been developed for decades, recently, derivative-free reinforcement learning exhibits attracting increasing attention. However, recent survey on this topic is still lacking. In this article, we summarize methods of derivative-free reinforcement learning to date, and organize the methods in aspects including parameter updating, model selection, exploration, and parallel/distributed methods. Moreover, we discuss some current limitations and possible future directions, hoping that this article could bring more attentions to this topic and serve as a catalyst for developing novel and efficient approaches.},

  abstract = {Predicting user responses, such as clicks and conversions, is of great importance and has found its usage in many Web applications including recommender systems, web search and online advertising. The data in those applications is mostly categorical and contains multiple fields; a typical representation is to transform it into a high-dimensional sparse binary feature representation via one-hot encoding. Facing with the extreme sparsity, traditional models may limit their capacity of mining shallow patterns from the data, i.e. low-order feature combinations. Deep models like deep neural networks, on the other hand, cannot be directly applied for the high-dimensional input because of the huge feature space. In this paper, we propose a Product-based Neural Networks (PNN) with an embedding layer to learn a distributed representation of the categorical data, a product layer to capture interactive patterns between inter-field categories, and further fully connected layers to explore high-order feature interactions. Our experimental results on two large-scale real-world ad click datasets demonstrate that PNNs consistently outperform the state-of-the-art models on various metrics.},

Currently, the most successful and widely-used activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Although various hand-designed alternatives to ReLU have been proposed, none have managed to replace it due to inconsistent gains. In this work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show that the best discovered activation function, \$f(x) = x {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}text\{sigmoid\}({\textbackslash}beta x)\$, which we name Swish, tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9{\textbackslash}\% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0.6{\textbackslash}\% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any neural network.},

Here, Deep RNN training is done with WMFO, and is developed by combining Moth Flame optimization (MFO) and Water wave optimization (WWO). Moreover, features are mined with opcodes and by finding term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) amongst individual features. Moreover, Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is adapted to choose significant features. These features are adapted in Deep RNN for classification, wherein the proposed WMFO is employed to produce optimum weights. The WMFO offered enhanced performance with elevated accuracy of 95.025\%, sensitivity of 95\%, and specificity of 96\%.},

To this end, we show that sparse coding algorithms, and the neural network-based learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (LISTA) among them, suffer from this sensitivity, and that common attacks on neural networks can be expressed as attacks on the sparse representation of the input image. The phenomenon that we observe holds true also when the network is agnostic to the sparse representation and dictionary, and thus can provide a possible explanation for the universality and transferability of adversarial attacks.

Secondly, the agent performs environmental interaction actions in each time step and returns a reward value. Finally, the optimal strategy for indoor temperature control is formulated by the agent.

Recently, however, the market for exploit kits has continued to evolve and what was once a rather hard-to-penetrate and exclusive market{\textemdash}whose buyers were primarily western governments [95], has now become more accessible to a much wider population. In particular, 2015 saw the introduction of darknet markets specializing in zero-day exploit kits{\textemdash}exploits designed to leverage previously undiscovered vulnerabilities. These markets, which were discussed in Chapters 3{\textendash}5, make exploits widely available to potential attackers. These exploit kits are difficult and time consuming to develop{\textemdash}and are often sold at premium prices. The cost associated with these sophisticated kits generally precludes penetration testers from simply obtaining such exploits, meaning an alternative approach is needed to understand what exploits an attacker will most likely purchase and how to defend against them. In this chapter, we introduce a data-driven security game framework to model an attacker and a defender of a specific system, providing system-specific policy recommendations to the defender. In addition to providing a formal framework and algorithms to develop strategies, we present experimental results from applying our framework, for various system configurations, on a subset of the real-world exploit data gathered from the system presented in Chapter 4. This game theoretic framework provides another example of rich cyber threat intelligence that can be derived from the darknet exploit data.},

At each arm pull, with some probability, the true reward samples are replaced with the samples from an arbitrary contamination distribution chosen by the adversary. We propose a median-based MO-MAB algorithm for robust PSI that abides by the accuracy requirements set by the user via an accuracy parameter. We prove that the sample complexity of this algorithm depends on the accuracy parameter inverse squarely. We compare the proposed algorithm with a mean-based method from MO-MAB literature on Gaussian reward distributions. Our numerical results verify our theoretical expectations and show the necessity for robust algorithm design in the adversarial setting.},

In particular, in the context of deep learning, we empirically show that the spectrum of the Hessian is composed of two parts: (1) the bulk centered near zero, (2) and outliers away from the bulk. We present numerical evidence and mathematical justifications to the following conjectures laid out by Sagun et al. (2016): Fixing data, increasing the number of parameters merely scales the bulk of the spectrum; fixing the dimension and changing the data (for instance adding more clusters or making the data less separable) only affects the outliers. We believe that our observations have striking implications for non-convex optimization in high dimensions. First, the flatness of such landscapes (which can be measured by the singularity of the Hessian) implies that classical notions of basins of attraction may be quite misleading. And that the discussion of wide/narrow basins may be in need of a new perspective around over-parametrization and redundancy that are able to create large connected components at the bottom of the landscape. Second, the dependence of small number of large eigenvalues to the data distribution can be linked to the spectrum of the covariance matrix of gradients of model outputs. With this in mind, we may reevaluate the connections within the data-architecture-algorithm framework of a model, hoping that it would shed light into the geometry of high-dimensional and non-convex spaces in modern applications. In particular, we present a case that links the two observations: small and large batch gradient descent appear to converge to different basins of attraction but we show that they are in fact connected through their flat region and so belong to the same basin.},

This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.},

We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3. The MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input an MobileNetV2 uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on Imagenet classification, COCO object detection, VOC image segmentation. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as the number of parameters},

  abstract = {Despite the widespread practical success of deep learning methods, our theoretical understanding of the dynamics of learning in deep neural networks remains quite sparse. We attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of deep learning by systematically analyzing learning dynamics for the restricted case of deep linear neural networks. Despite the linearity of their input-output map, such networks have nonlinear gradient descent dynamics on weights that change with the addition of each new hidden layer. We show that deep linear networks exhibit nonlinear learning phenomena similar to those seen in simulations of nonlinear networks, including long plateaus followed by rapid transitions to lower error solutions, and faster convergence from greedy unsupervised pretraining initial conditions than from random initial conditions. We provide an analytical description of these phenomena by finding new exact solutions to the nonlinear dynamics of deep learning. Our theoretical analysis also reveals the surprising finding that as the depth of a network approaches infinity, learning speed can nevertheless remain finite: for a special class of initial conditions on the weights, very deep networks incur only a finite, depth independent, delay in learning speed relative to shallow networks. We show that, under certain conditions on the training data, unsupervised pretraining can find this special class of initial conditions, while scaled random Gaussian initializations cannot. We further exhibit a new class of random orthogonal initial conditions on weights that, like unsupervised pre-training, enjoys depth independent learning times. We further show that these initial conditions also lead to faithful propagation of gradients even in deep nonlinear networks, as long as they operate in a special regime known as the edge of chaos.},

These computations have a surprisingly large carbon footprint [38]. Ironically, deep learning was inspired by the human brain, which is remarkably energy efficient. Moreover, the financial cost of the computations can make it difficult for academics, students, and researchers, in particular those from emerging economies, to engage in deep learning research. This position paper advocates a practical solution by making efficiency an evaluation criterion for research alongside accuracy and related measures. In addition, we propose reporting the financial cost or "price tag" of developing, training, and running models to provide baselines for the investigation of increasingly efficient methods. Our goal is to make AI both greener and more inclusive---enabling any inspired undergraduate with a laptop to write high-quality research papers.

  abstract = {It is almost always easier to find an accurate-but-complex model than an accurate-yet-simple model. Finding optimal, sparse, accurate models of various forms (linear models with integer coefficients, decision sets, rule lists, decision trees) is generally NP-hard. We often do not know whether the search for a simpler model will be worthwhile, and thus we do not go to the trouble of searching for one. In this work, we ask an important practical question: can accurate-yet-simple models be proven to exist, or shown likely to exist, before explicitly searching for them? We hypothesize that there is an important reason that simple-yet-accurate models often do exist. This hypothesis is that the size of the Rashomon set is often large, where the Rashomon set is the set of almost-equally-accurate models from a function class. If the Rashomon set is large, it contains numerous accurate models, and perhaps at least one of them is the simple model we desire. In this work, we formally present the Rashomon ratio as a new gauge of simplicity for a learning problem, depending on a function class and a data set. The Rashomon ratio is the ratio of the volume of the set of accurate models to the volume of the hypothesis space, and it is different from standard complexity measures from statistical learning theory. Insight from studying the Rashomon ratio provides an easy way to check whether a simpler model might exist for a problem before finding it, namely whether several different machine learning methods achieve similar performance on the data. In that sense, the Rashomon ratio is a powerful tool for understanding why and when an accurate-yet-simple model might exist. If, as we hypothesize in this work, many real-world data sets admit large Rashomon sets, the implications are vast: it means that simple or interpretable models may often be used for high-stakes decisions without losing accuracy.},

  abstract = {Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13){\textemdash}a blind assessment of the state of the field{\textemdash}AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7. AlphaFold predicts the distances between pairs of residues, is used to construct potentials of mean force that accurately describe the shape of a protein and can be optimized with gradient descent to predict protein structures.},

Many prior efforts have addressed this problem using either alternative loss functions or sampling strategies that focus on rare patterns. We propose a new direction: modifying the network architecture to impose inductive biases that make the network robust to dataset bias. Specifically, we propose OccamNets, which are biased to favor simpler solutions by design. OccamNets have two inductive biases. First, they are biased to use as little network depth as needed for an individual example. Second, they are biased toward using fewer image locations for prediction. While OccamNets are biased toward simpler hypotheses, they can learn more complex hypotheses if necessary. In experiments, OccamNets outperform or rival state-of-the-art methods run on architectures that do not incorporate these inductive biases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the state-of-the-art debiasing methods are combined with OccamNets results further improve.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses `value networks' to evaluate board positions and `policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.

This leads to a long training time for dense neural networks to achieve good performance. Hence, prohibitive computation and memory resources are consumed. Recently, learning efficient DRL agents has received increasing attention. Yet, current methods focus on accelerating inference time. In this paper, we introduce for the first time a dynamic sparse training approach for deep reinforcement learning to accelerate the training process. The proposed approach trains a sparse neural network from scratch and dynamically adapts its topology to the changing data distribution during training. Experiments on continuous control tasks show that our dynamic sparse agents achieve higher performance than the equivalent dense methods, reduce the parameter count and floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 50\%, and have a faster learning speed that enables reaching the performance of dense agents with 40-50\% reduction in the training steps.},

This result holds for an arbitrary training data of input/output pairs. For differentiable activation functions, we also show that gradient descent, when suitably initialized, converges at a linear rate to a globally optimal model.

  abstract = {Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which aims to predict the probability of a user clicking on an ad or an item, is critical to many online applications such as online advertising and recommender systems. The problem is very challenging since (1) the input features (e.g., the user id, user age, item id, item category) are usually sparse and high-dimensional, and (2) an effective prediction relies on high-order combinatorial features ({\textbackslash}textit\{a.k.a.\} cross features), which are very time-consuming to hand-craft by domain experts and are impossible to be enumerated. Therefore, there have been efforts in finding low-dimensional representations of the sparse and high-dimensional raw features and their meaningful combinations. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient method called the {\textbackslash}emph\{AutoInt\} to automatically learn the high-order feature interactions of input features. Our proposed algorithm is very general, which can be applied to both numerical and categorical input features. Specifically, we map both the numerical and categorical features into the same low-dimensional space. Afterwards, a multi-head self-attentive neural network with residual connections is proposed to explicitly model the feature interactions in the low-dimensional space. With different layers of the multi-head self-attentive neural networks, different orders of feature combinations of input features can be modeled. The whole model can be efficiently fit on large-scale raw data in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that our proposed approach not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for prediction but also offers good explainability.

  abstract = {Ultrasound imaging or sonomyography has been found to be a robust modality for sensing muscle activity due to its ability to directly image deep-seated muscles while providing superior spatiotemporal specificity compared to surface electromyography- based techniques. Quantifying the morphological changes during muscle activity involves computationally expensive approaches to track muscle anatomical structures or extracting features from B-mode images and A-mode signals. In this paper an offline regression convolutional neural network (CNN) called SonoMyoNet for estimating continuous isometric force from sparse ultrasound scanlines has been presented. SonoMyoNet learns features from a few equispaced scanlines selected from B-mode images and utilizes the learned features to accurately estimate continuous isometric force. The performance of SonoMyoNet was evaluated by varying the number of scanlines to simulate the placement of multiple single element ultrasound transducers in a wearable system. Results showed that SonoMyoNet could accurately predict isometric force with just four scanlines and is immune to speckle noise and shifts in the scanline location. Thus, the proposed network reduces the computational load involved in feature tracking algorithms and estimates muscle force from global features of sparse ultrasound images.},

This paper is devoted to a numerical study of adaptive approximation of solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations whose solutions may have singularities, by deep neural networks (DNNs) with a sparse regularization with multiple parameters. Noting that DNNs have an intrinsic multi-scale structure which is favorable for adaptive representation of functions, by employing a penalty with multiple parameters, we develop DNNs with a multi-scale sparse regularization (SDNN) for effectively representing functions having certain singularities. We then apply the proposed SDNN to numerical solutions of the Burgers equation and the Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation. Numerical examples confirm that solutions generated by the proposed SDNN are sparse and accurate.},

  abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different {\^a}thinned{\^a} networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

  abstract = {Much of recent machine learning has focused on deep learning, in which neural network weights are trained through variants of stochastic gradient descent. An alternative approach comes from the field of neuroevolution, which harnesses evolutionary algorithms to optimize neural networks, inspired by the fact that natural brains themselves are the products of an evolutionary process. Neuroevolution enables important capabilities that are typically unavailable to gradient-based approaches, including learning neural network building blocks (for example activation functions), hyperparameters, architectures and even the algorithms for learning themselves. Neuroevolution also differs from deep learning (and deep reinforcement learning) by maintaining a population of solutions during search, enabling extreme exploration and massive parallelization. Finally, because neuroevolution research has (until recently) developed largely in isolation from gradient-based neural network research, it has developed many unique and effective techniques that should be effective in other machine learning areas too. This Review looks at several key aspects of modern neuroevolution, including large-scale computing, the benefits of novelty and diversity, the power of indirect encoding, and the field's contributions to meta-learning and architecture search. Our hope is to inspire renewed interest in the field as it meets the potential of the increasing computation available today, to highlight how many of its ideas can provide an exciting resource for inspiration and hybridization to the deep learning, deep reinforcement learning and machine learning communities, and to explain how neuroevolution could prove to be a critical tool in the long-term pursuit of artificial general intelligence.},

  abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained via gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference approximation of the gradient. That raises the question of whether non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. Here we demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple, gradient-free, population-based genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the multitude of neuroevolution techniques that improve performance. We demonstrate the latter by showing that combining DNNs with novelty search, which encourages exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g.{\textbackslash} DQN, A3C, ES, and the GA) fail. Additionally, the Deep GA is faster than ES, A3C, and DQN (it can train Atari in \$\{{\textbackslash}raise.17ex{\textbackslash}hbox\{\${\textbackslash}scriptstyle{\textbackslash}sim\$\}\}\$4 hours on one desktop or \$\{{\textbackslash}raise.17ex{\textbackslash}hbox\{\${\textbackslash}scriptstyle{\textbackslash}sim\$\}\}\$1 hour distributed on 720 cores), and enables a state-of-the-art, up to 10,000-fold compact encoding technique.},

Two measures are particularly useful for this: 1) a ranking-based measure, favoring decision variables that frequently appear in high-quality solutions; and 2) a correlation-based measure, favoring decision variables that are highly correlated with the objective values. To take this further we develop a machine learning approach, called Machine Learning for Problem Reduction (MLPR), that trains a supervised learning model on easy problem instances for which the optimal solution is known. This gives us a combination of features enabling us to better predict the decision variables that belong to the optimal solution for a given hard problem. We evaluate our approaches using a typical optimization problem on graphs-the maximum weight clique problem. The experimental results show our problem reduction techniques are very effective and can be used to boost the performance of existing solution methods.},

  doi = {arXiv:2205.15322v1},
  abstract = {Recent works on sparse neural network training (sparse training) have shown that a compelling trade-off between performance and efficiency can be achieved by training intrinsically sparse neural networks from scratch. Existing sparse training methods usually strive to find the best sparse subnetwork possible in one single run, without involving any expensive dense or pre-training steps. For instance, dynamic sparse training (DST), as one of the most prominent directions, is capable of reaching a competitive performance of dense training by iteratively evolving the sparse topology during the course of training. In this paper, we argue that it is better to allocate the limited resources to create multiple low-loss sparse subnetworks and superpose them into a stronger one, instead of allocating all resources entirely to find an individual subnetwork. To achieve this, two desiderata are required: (1) efficiently producing many low-loss subnetworks, the so-called cheap tickets, within one training process limited to the standard training time used in dense training; (2) effectively superposing these cheap tickets into one stronger subnetwork without going over the constrained parameter budget. To corroborate our conjecture, we present a novel sparse training approach, termed {\textbackslash}textbf\{Sup-tickets\}, which can satisfy the above two desiderata concurrently in a single sparse-to-sparse training process. Across various modern architectures on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, we show that Sup-tickets integrates seamlessly with the existing sparse training methods and demonstrates consistent performance improvement.},

In this review, to improve the efficiency of deep learning research, we focus on three aspects: quantized/binarized models, optimized architectures, and resource-constrained systems. Recent advances in light-weight deep learning models and network architecture search (NAS) algorithms are reviewed, starting with simplified layers and efficient convolution and including new architectural design and optimization. In addition, several practical applications of efficient CNNs have been investigated using various types of hardware architectures and platforms.},

In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves stateof-the-art 84.4\% top-1 / 97.1\% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet (Huang et al., 2018). Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7\%), Flower (98.8\%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.},

  abstract = {It is a triumph of technology and of economics that our computer chips are so universal. Countless applications are only possible because of the staggering variety of calculations that modern chips can compute. But, this was not always the case. Computers used to be specialized, doing only narrow sets of calculations. Their rise as a 'general purpose technology (GPT)' only happened because of the technical breakthroughs by computer scientists like von Neumann and Turing, and the mutually-reinforcing economic cycle of general purpose technologies, where product improvement and market growth fuel each other. This paper argues that technological and economic forces are now pushing computing in the opposite direction, making computer processors less general purpose and more specialized. This process has already begun, driven by the slow down in Moore's Law and the algorithmic success of Deep Learning. This trend towards specialization threatens to fragment computing into 'fast lane' applications that get powerful customized chips and 'slow lane' applications that get stuck using general purpose chips whose progress fades.The rise of general purpose computer chips has been remarkable. So, too, could be their fall. This paper outlines the forces already starting to fragment this general purpose technology.},

MLP-Mixer contains two types of layers: one with MLPs applied independently to image patches (i.e. "mixing" the per-location features), and one with MLPs applied across patches (i.e. "mixing" spatial information). When trained on large datasets, or with modern regularization schemes, MLP-Mixer attains competitive scores on image classification benchmarks, with pre-training and inference cost comparable to state-of-the-art models.

To this end, RSO adds a perturbation to a weight in a deep neural network and tests if it reduces the loss on a mini-batch. If this reduces the loss, the weight is updated, otherwise the existing weight is retained. Surprisingly, we find that repeating this process a few times for each weight is sufficient to train a deep neural network. The number of weight updates for RSO is an order of magnitude lesser when compared to backpropagation with SGD. RSO can make aggressive weight updates in each step as there is no concept of learning rate. The weight update step for individual layers is also not coupled with the magnitude of the loss. RSO is evaluated on classification tasks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with deep neural networks of 6 to 10 layers where it achieves an accuracy of 99.1\% and 81.8\% respectively. We also find that after updating the weights just 5 times, the algorithm obtains a classification accuracy of 98\% on MNIST.},

Yet, this efficiency is just in theory. In practice, everyone uses a binary mask to simulate sparsity since the typical deep learning software and hardware are optimized for dense matrix operations. In this paper, we take an orthogonal approach, and we show that we can train truly sparse neural networks to harvest their full potential. To achieve this goal, we introduce three novel contributions, specially designed for sparse neural networks: (1) a parallel training algorithm and its corresponding sparse implementation from scratch, (2) an activation function with non-trainable parameters to favour the gradient flow, and (3) a hidden neurons importance metric to eliminate redundancies. All in one, we are able to break the record and to train the largest neural network ever trained in terms of representational power -- reaching the bat brain size. The results show that our approach has state-of-the-art performance while opening the path for an environmentally friendly artificial intelligence era.},

  abstract = {For unsupervised pretraining, mask-reconstruction pretraining (MRP) approaches randomly mask input patches and then reconstruct pixels or semantic features of these masked patches via an auto-encoder. Then for a downstream task, supervised fine-tuning the pretrained encoder remarkably surpasses the conventional supervised learning (SL) trained from scratch. However, it is still unclear 1) how MRP performs semantic learning in the pretraining phase and 2) why it helps in downstream tasks. To solve these problems, we theoretically show that on an auto-encoder of a two/one-layered convolution encoder/decoder, MRP can capture all discriminative semantics in the pretraining dataset, and accordingly show its provable improvement over SL on the classification downstream task. Specifically, we assume that pretraining dataset contains multi-view samples of ratio  and single-view samples of ratio , where multi/single-view samples has multiple/single discriminative semantics. Then for pretraining, we prove that 1) the convolution kernels of the MRP encoder captures all discriminative semantics in the pretraining data; and 2) a convolution kernel captures at most one semantic. Accordingly, in the downstream supervised fine-tuning, most semantics would be captured and different semantics would not be fused together. This helps the downstream fine-tuned network to easily establish the relation between kernels and semantic class labels. In this way, the fine-tuned encoder in MRP provably achieves zero test error with high probability for both multi-view and single-view test data. In contrast, as proved by{\textasciitilde}[3], conventional SL can only obtain a test accuracy between around  for single-view test data. These results together explain the benefits of MRP in downstream tasks. Experimental results testify to multi-view data assumptions and our theoretical implications.},

It begins by categorising over 150 studies based on the underlying approach used and then focuses on three categories: methods that use magnitude based pruning, methods that utilise clustering to identify redundancy, and methods that use sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of pruning. Some of the key influencing studies within these categories are presented to highlight the underlying approaches and results achieved. Most studies present results which are distributed in the literature as new architectures, algorithms and data sets have developed with time, making comparison across different studied difficult. The paper therefore provides a resource for the community that can be used to quickly compare the results from many different methods on a variety of data sets, and a range of architectures, including AlexNet, ResNet, DenseNet and VGG. The resource is illustrated by comparing the results published for pruning AlexNet and ResNet50 on ImageNet and ResNet56 and VGG16 on the CIFAR10 data to reveal which pruning methods work well in terms of retaining accuracy whilst achieving good compression rates. The paper concludes by identifying some research gaps and promising directions for future research.},

As a stepping stone to this goal, the domain of StarCraft has emerged as an important challenge for artificial intelligence research, owing to its iconic and enduring status among the most difficult professional esports and its relevance to the real world in terms of its raw complexity and multi-agent challenges. Over the course of a decade and numerous competitions1{\textendash}3, the strongest agents have simplified important aspects of the game, utilized superhuman capabilities, or employed hand-crafted sub-systems4. Despite these advantages, no previous agent has come close to matching the overall skill of top StarCraft players.

We evaluated our agent, AlphaStar, in the full game of StarCraft II, through a series of online games against human players. AlphaStar was rated at Grandmaster level for all three StarCraft races and above 99.8\% of officially ranked human players.

  abstract = {Many real-world applications require artificial agents to compete and coordinate with other agents in complex environments. As a stepping stone to this goal, the domain of StarCraft has emerged as an important challenge for artificial intelligence research, owing to its iconic and enduring status among the most difficult professional esports and its relevance to the real world in terms of its raw complexity and multi-agent challenges. Over the course of a decade and numerous competitions1{\textendash}3, the strongest agents have simplified important aspects of the game, utilized superhuman capabilities, or employed hand-crafted sub-systems4. Despite these advantages, no previous agent has come close to matching the overall skill of top StarCraft players. We chose to address the challenge of StarCraft using general-purpose learning methods that are in principle applicable to other complex domains: a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that uses data from both human and agent games within a diverse league of continually adapting strategies and counter-strategies, each represented by deep neural networks5,6. We evaluated our agent, AlphaStar, in the full game of StarCraft II, through a series of online games against human players. AlphaStar was rated at Grandmaster level for all three StarCraft races and above 99.8\% of officially ranked human players. AlphaStar uses a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm and has reached Grandmaster level, ranking among the top 0.2\% of human players for the real-time strategy game StarCraft II.},

Applied to ImageNet, this leads to object centric features that perform on par with supervised features on most object-centric downstream tasks. In this work, we question if using this ability, we can learn any salient and more representative information present in diverse unbounded set of images from across the globe. To do so, we train models on billions of random images without any data pre-processing or prior assumptions about what we want the model to learn. We scale our model size to dense 10 billion parameters to avoid underfitting on a large data size. We extensively study and validate our model performance on over 50 benchmarks including fairness, robustness to distribution shift, geographical diversity, fine grained recognition, image copy detection and many image classification datasets. The resulting model, not only captures well semantic information, it also captures information about artistic style and learns salient information such as geolocations and multilingual word embeddings based on visual content only. More importantly, we discover that such model is more robust, more fair, less harmful and less biased than supervised models or models trained on object centric datasets such as ImageNet.},

  abstract = {Studying neural network loss landscapes provides insights into the nature of the underlying optimization problems. Unfortunately, loss landscapes are notoriously difficult to visualize in a human-comprehensible fashion. One common way to address this problem is to plot linear slices of the landscape, for example from the initial state of the network to the final state after optimization. On the basis of this analysis, prior work has drawn broader conclusions about the difficulty of the optimization problem. In this paper, we put inferences of this kind to the test, systematically evaluating how linear interpolation and final performance vary when altering the data, choice of initialization, and other optimizer and architecture design choices. Further, we use linear interpolation to study the role played by individual layers and substructures of the network. We find that certain layers are more sensitive to the choice of initialization, but that the shape of the linear path is not indicative of the changes in test accuracy of the model. Our results cast doubt on the broader intuition that the presence or absence of barriers when interpolating necessarily relates to the success of optimization.},

  abstract = {Neural network pruning is a fruitful area of research with surging interest in high sparsity regimes. Benchmarking in this domain heavily relies on faithful representation of the sparsity of subnetworks, which has been traditionally computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct sparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize unpruned parameters that detached from input or output layers of the underlying subnetworks, potentially underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of inactivated connections. While this effect might be negligible for moderately pruned networks (up to 10{\texttimes}{\textendash}100{\texttimes} compression rates), we find that it plays an increasing role for sparser subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison between different pruning algorithms. For example, we show that effective compression of a randomly pruned LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its direct counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed when using SynFlow for pruning (Tanaka et al., 2020). In this work, we adopt the lens of effective sparsity to reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common benchmark architectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19, ResNet-18) and discover that their absolute and relative performance changes dramatically in this new, and as we argue, more appropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than direct, sparsity, we develop a low-cost extension to most pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with effective sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that random pruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across layers performs as well or better than more sophisticated algorithms for pruning at initialization (Su et al., 2020). In response to this observation, using an analogy of pressure distribution in coupled cylinders from thermodynamics, we design novel layerwise sparsity quotas that outperform all existing baselines in the context of random pruning.},

Unfortunately, the reason behind it remains elusive up to date. This paper is meant to explain it through the lens of dynamical isometry [42]. Specifically, we examine neural network pruning from an unusual perspective: pruning as initialization for finetuning, and ask whether the inherited weights serve as a good initialization for the finetuning? The insights from dynamical isometry suggest a negative answer. Despite its critical role, this issue has not been well-recognized by the community so far. In this paper, we will show the understanding of this problem is very important -- on top of explaining the aforementioned mystery about the larger finetuning rate, it also unveils the mystery about the value of pruning [5, 30]. Besides a clearer theoretical understanding of pruning, resolving the problem can also bring us considerable performance benefits in practice.},

As opposed to existing Hessian-based pruning algorithms which do pruning in parameter coordinates, our method works in the KFE where different weights are approximately independent, enabling accurate pruning and fast computation. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments. In particular, we highlight that the improvements are especially significant for more challenging datasets and networks. With negligible loss of accuracy, an iterative-pruning version gives a 10x reduction in model size and a 8x reduction in FLOPs on wide ResNet32.},

  abstract = {Regularization has long been utilized to learn sparsity in deep neural network pruning. However, its role is mainly explored in the small penalty strength regime. In this work, we extend its application to a new scenario where the regularization grows large gradually to tackle two central problems of pruning: pruning schedule and weight importance scoring. (1) The former topic is newly brought up in this work, which we find critical to the pruning performance while receives little research attention. Specifically, we propose an L2 regularization variant with rising penalty factors and show it can bring significant accuracy gains compared with its one-shot counterpart, even when the same weights are removed. (2) The growing penalty scheme also brings us an approach to exploit the Hessian information for more accurate pruning without knowing their specific values, thus not bothered by the common Hessian approximation problems. Empirically, the proposed algorithms are easy to implement and scalable to large datasets and networks in both structured and unstructured pruning. Their effectiveness is demonstrated with modern deep neural networks on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, achieving competitive results compared to many state-of-the-art algorithms.

We aim to prune networks at initialization, thereby saving resources at training time as well. Specifically, we argue that efficient training requires preserving the gradient flow through the network. This leads to a simple but effective pruning criterion we term Gradient Signal Preservation (GraSP). We empirically investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method with extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet, using VGGNet and ResNet architectures. Our method can prune 80\% of the weights of a VGG-16 network on ImageNet at initialization, with only a 1.6\% drop in top-1 accuracy.

Unlike existing deterministic pruning approaches, where unimportant weights are permanently eliminated, SPP introduces a pruning probability for each weight, and pruning is guided by sampling from the pruning probabilities. A mechanism is designed to increase and decrease pruning probabilities based on importance criteria in the training process. Experiments show that, with 4x speedup, SPP can accelerate AlexNet with only 0.3\% loss of top-5 accuracy and VGG-16 with 0.8\% loss of top-5 accuracy in ImageNet classification. Moreover, SPP can be directly applied to accelerate multi-branch CNN networks, such as ResNet, without specific adaptations. Our 2x speedup ResNet-50 only suffers 0.8\% loss of top-5 accuracy on ImageNet. We further show the effectiveness of SPP on transfer learning tasks.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on training deep neural networks capable of state-of-the-art performance without the need for the expensive over-parameterization by proposing the concept of In-Time Over-Parameterization (ITOP) in sparse training. By starting from a random sparse network and continuously exploring sparse connectivities during training, we can perform an Over-Parameterization in the space-time manifold, closing the gap in the expressibility between sparse training and dense training. We further use ITOP to understand the underlying mechanism of Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) and indicate that the benefits of DST come from its ability to consider across time all possible parameters when searching for the optimal sparse connectivity. As long as there are sufficient parameters that have been reliably explored during training, DST can outperform the dense neural network by a large margin. We present a series of experiments to support our conjecture and achieve the state-of-the-art sparse training performance with ResNet-50 on ImageNet. More impressively, our method achieves dominant performance over the overparameterization-based sparse methods at extreme sparsity levels. When trained on CIFAR-100, our method can match the performance of the dense model even at an extreme sparsity (98\%).

Quantifying loss of population diversity is crucial for designing evolutionary algorithms in which the search process is directed through controlling population diversity via parameters of a selection scheme.

  abstract = {The success of neural networks has driven a shift in focus from feature engineering to architecture engineering. However, successful networks today are constructed using a small and manually defined set of building blocks. Even in methods of neural architecture search (NAS) the network connectivity patterns are largely constrained. In this work we propose a method for discovering neural wirings. We relax the typical notion of layers and instead enable channels to form connections independent of each other. This allows for a much larger space of possible networks. The wiring of our network is not fixed during training -- as we learn the network parameters we also learn the structure itself. Our experiments demonstrate that our learned connectivity outperforms hand engineered and randomly wired networks. By learning the connectivity of MobileNetV1we boost the ImageNet accuracy by 10\% at {\textasciitilde}41M FLOPs. Moreover, we show that our method generalizes to recurrent and continuous time networks. Our work may also be regarded as unifying core aspects of the neural architecture search problem with sparse neural network learning. As NAS becomes more fine grained, finding a good architecture is akin to finding a sparse subnetwork of the complete graph. Accordingly, DNW provides an effective mechanism for discovering sparse subnetworks of predefined architectures in a single training run. Though we only ever use a small percentage of the weights during the forward pass, we still play the so-called initialization lottery with a combinatorial number of subnetworks. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/allenai/dnw while additional visualizations may be found at https://mitchellnw.github.io/blog/2019/dnw/.},

  abstract = {Semi-supervised learning lately has shown much promise in improving deep learning models when labeled data is scarce. Common among recent approaches is the use of consistency training on a large amount of unlabeled data to constrain model predictions to be invariant to input noise. In this work, we present a new perspective on how to effectively noise unlabeled examples and argue that the quality of noising, specifically those produced by advanced data augmentation methods, plays a crucial role in semi-supervised learning. By substituting simple noising operations with advanced data augmentation methods such as RandAugment and back-translation, our method brings substantial improvements across six language and three vision tasks under the same consistency training framework. On the IMDb text classification dataset, with only 20 labeled examples, our method achieves an error rate of 4.20, outperforming the state-of-the-art model trained on 25,000 labeled examples. On a standard semi-supervised learning benchmark, CIFAR-10, our method outperforms all previous approaches and achieves an error rate of 5.43 with only 250 examples. Our method also combines well with transfer learning, e.g., when finetuning from BERT, and yields improvements in high-data regime, such as ImageNet, whether when there is only 10\% labeled data or when a full labeled set with 1.3M extra unlabeled examples is used.

Specifically, we train a Sparse Graph Network (SGN) with supervised learning for edge scores and unsupervised learning for node penalties, both of which are critical for improving the performance of LKH. Based on the output of SGN, NeuroLKH creates the edge candidate set and transforms edge distances to guide the searching process of LKH. Extensive experiments firmly demonstrate that, by training one model on a wide range of problem sizes, NeuroLKH significantly outperforms LKH and generalizes well to much larger sizes. Also, we show that NeuroLKH can be applied to other routing problems such as Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP), and CVRP with Time Windows (CVRPTW).},

The high requirement for the model to be more computationally efficient on lower information and communication technology (ICT) resource, e.g., mobile terminals can benefit from model distillation. However, most existing distillation methods suffer from a significant accuracy reduction, which requires a large number of pre-training models or doesn't make good use of the more of the network information, e.g., in the middle layers, during the distillation. In this paper, we study how knowledge about traffic signs recognition could be transferred to smaller models by distillation while cutting channels. We present an optimized object detection network, which uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) weighted loss and hard-soft distribution-wise distillation loss for structural differences between teacher and student networks. We validate the network on multiple real-world datasets, the experiments demonstrate that the classification accuracy can be improved by 9 \% with about 16 times parameter reduction while the detection network performance could be increased by 10.6\% using an optimized object detection network. {\textcopyright} 2021 IEEE.},

These correlations are robust to controlling for early life background and other demographic and socioeconomic factors.

These issues are particularly acute in highly non-convex settings such as those arising in neural networks. Motivated by this, there has been recent interest in second-order methods that aim to alleviate these shortcomings by capturing curvature information. In this paper, we report detailed empirical evaluations of a class of Newton-type methods, namely sub-sampled variants of trust region (TR) and adaptive regularization with cubics (ARC) algorithms, for non-convex ML problems. In doing so, we demonstrate that these methods not only can be computationally competitive with hand-tuned SGD with momentum, obtaining comparable or better generalization performance, but also they are highly robust to hyper-parameter settings. Further, we show that the manner in which these Newton-type methods employ curvature information allows them to seamlessly escape flat regions and saddle points.},

This general framework can be used to analyze neural network models, including the topology of the loss landscape (i.e., curvature information) to gain insight into the behavior of different models/optimizers. As an example, we analyze the effect of residual connections and Batch Normalization layers on the trainability of neural networks. One recent claim, based on simpler first-order analysis, is that residual connections and Batch Normalization make the loss landscape "smoother," thus making it easier for Stochastic Gradient Descent to converge to a good solution. Our second-order analysis, easily enabled by PYHESSIAN, shows new finer-scale insights, demonstrating that while conventional wisdom is sometimes validated, in other cases it is simply incorrect. In particular, we find that Batch Normalization does not necessarily make the loss landscape smoother, especially for shallow networks.},

  abstract = {Recent works on sparse neural network training (sparse training) have shown that a compelling trade-off between performance and efficiency can be achieved by training intrinsically sparse neural networks from scratch. Existing sparse training methods usually strive to find the best sparse subnetwork possible in one single run, without involving any expensive dense or pre-training steps. For instance, dynamic sparse training (DST), as one of the most prominent directions, is capable of reaching a competitive performance of dense training by iteratively evolving the sparse topology during the course of training. In this paper, we argue that it is better to allocate the limited resources to create multiple low-loss sparse subnetworks and superpose them into a stronger one, instead of allocating all resources entirely to find an individual subnetwork. To achieve this, two desiderata are required: (1) efficiently producing many low-loss subnetworks, the so-called cheap tickets, within one training process limited to the standard training time used in dense training; (2) effectively superposing these cheap tickets into one stronger subnetwork without going over the constrained parameter budget. To corroborate our conjecture, we present a novel sparse training approach, termed {\textbackslash}textbf\{Sup-tickets\}, which can satisfy the above two desiderata concurrently in a single sparse-to-sparse training process. Across various modern architectures on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, we show that Sup-tickets integrates seamlessly with the existing sparse training methods and demonstrates consistent performance improvement.},

  abstract = {Pruning is an effective method to reduce the memory footprint and FLOPs associated with neural network models. However, existing structured-pruning methods often result in significant accuracy degradation for moderate pruning levels. To address this problem, we introduce a new Hessian Aware Pruning (HAP) method coupled with a Neural Implant approach that uses second-order sensitivity as a metric for structured pruning. The basic idea is to prune insensitive components and to use a Neural Implant for moderately sensitive components, instead of completely pruning them. For the latter approach, the moderately sensitive components are replaced with a low rank implant that is smaller and less computationally expensive than the original component. We use the relative Hessian trace to measure sensitivity, as opposed to the magnitude based sensitivity metric commonly used in the literature. We test HAP for both computer vision tasks and natural language tasks, and we achieve new state-of-the-art results. Specifically, HAP achieves less than 0.1\%/0.5\% degradation on PreResNet29/ResNet50 (CIFAR-10/ImageNet) with more than 70\%/50\% of parameters pruned. Meanwhile, HAP also achieves significantly better performance (up to 0.8\% with 60\% of parameters pruned) as compared to gradient based method for head pruning on transformer-based models. The framework has been open sourced and available online: https://github.com/yaozhewei/HAP.},

  abstract = {Transformers have shown great potential in computer vision tasks. A common belief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their competence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in transformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still perform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general architecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module, is more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately replace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple spatial pooling operator to conduct only the most basic token mixing. Surprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves competitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on ImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1\% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned vision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3\%/1.1\% accuracy with 35\%/52\% fewer parameters and 48\%/60\% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of PoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of "MetaFormer", a general architecture abstracted from transformers without specifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that MetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent transformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more future research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the token mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a starting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design. Code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/poolformer},

Beyond exploiting relations between classes of seen and unseen, we present a deep generative model to provide the model with experience about both seen and unseen classes. Based on the variational auto-encoder with class-specific multi-modal prior, the proposed method learns the conditional distribution of seen and unseen classes. In order to circumvent the need for samples of unseen classes, we treat the non-existing data as missing examples. That is, our network aims to find optimal unseen datapoints and model parameters, by iteratively following the generating and learning strategy. Since we obtain the conditional generative model for both seen and unseen classes, classification as well as generation can be performed directly without any off-the-shell classifiers. In experimental results, we demonstrate that the proposed generating and learning strategy makes the model achieve the outperforming results compared to that trained only on the seen classes, and also to the several state-of-the-art methods.},

However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR, SVHN, COCO, and significant improvements on ImageNet.

Along the way, we refine the architecture and training of ViT, reducing memory consumption and increasing accuracy the resulting models. As a result, we successfully train a ViT model with two billion parameters, which attains a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet of 90.45\% top-1 accuracy. The model also performs well on few-shot learning, for example, attaining 84.86\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 10 examples per class.},

We then propose Modular Risk Minimization to solve the subnetwork selection problem. Our algorithm learns the functional structure from a given dataset, and can be combined with any other OOD regularization methods. Experiments on various OOD generalization tasks corroborate the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract = {Filter pruning has drawn extensive attention due to its advantage in reducing computational costs and memory requirements of deep convolutional neural networks. However, most existing methods only prune filters based on their intrinsic properties or spatial feature maps, ignoring the correlation between filters. In this paper, we suggest the correlation is valuable and consider it from a novel view: the frequency domain. Specifically, we first transfer features to the frequency domain by Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Then, for each feature map, we compute a uniqueness score, which measures its probability of being replaced by others. This way allows to prune the filters corresponding to the low-uniqueness maps without significant performance degradation. Compared to the methods focusing on intrinsic properties, our proposed method introduces a more comprehensive criterion to prune filters, further improving the network compactness while preserving good performance. In addition, our method is more robust against noise than the spatial ones since the critical clues for pruning are more concentrated after DCT. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method. To be specific, our method outperforms the baseline ResNet-56 by 0.38\% on CIFAR-10 while reducing the floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 47.4\%. In addition, a consistent improvement can be observed when pruning the baseline ResNet-110: 0.23\% performance increase and up to 71\% FLOPs drop. Finally, on ImageNet, our method reduces the FLOPs of the baseline ResNet-50 by 48.7\% with only 0.32\% accuracy loss.},

  abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) enjoy the welfare of convolution, while also bearing huge computational pressure. Therefore, model compression techniques are used to alleviate this problem, where filter-based neural network has received extensive attention as the research object of this paper. Common approaches treat filters as independent individuals and choose retrained filters by evaluating their performance, while more complex macro methods consider relationship between filters. Therefore, we propose a facile distance-based filter selection method, called FPFS, to visualize the similarity between filters from a global perspective. We calculate and sum the distance between filters to get filters' ``Distance Weight'' which is applied as a metric to assess filters. We use four common and appropriate distances for filters evaluation. To verify the performance of our algorithm, we introduce FPFS to classical DCNNs and test it on general classification datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and mageNet. For example, FPFS reduces Parameters and FLOPs of the lightweight model DenseNet-40 to about half of the original while maintain accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 94.40\% (the original model is 94.80\%). To ResNet-56 on CIFAR-100, FPFS compresses FLOPs to less than half of the original, while model accuracy reaches 71.46\% (the original model is 71.44\%). About ResNet-50 on ImageNet, FPFS achieves 60.3\% FLOPs pruning rate accompanied by 0.96\% top-1 accuracy loss. We also compare the experimental results with state-of-the-art filter pruning algorithms to highlight the effectiveness of FPFS.},

  abstract = {Network pruning is an effective approach to reduce network complexity with acceptable performance compromise. Existing studies achieve the sparsity of neural networks via time-consuming weight training or complex searching on networks with expanded width, which greatly limits the applications of network pruning. In this paper, we show that high-performing and sparse sub-networks without the involvement of weight training, termed "lottery jackpots", exist in pre-trained models with unexpanded width. Furthermore, we improve the efficiency for searching lottery jackpots from two perspectives. Firstly, we observe that the sparse masks derived from many existing pruning criteria have a high overlap with the searched mask of our lottery jackpot, among which, the magnitude-based pruning results in the most similar mask with ours. Consequently, our searched lottery jackpot removes 90\% weights in ResNet-50, while it easily obtains more than 70\% top-1 accuracy using only 5 searching epochs on ImageNet. In compliance with this insight, we initialize our sparse mask using the magnitude-based pruning, resulting in at least 3x cost reduction on the lottery jackpot searching while achieving comparable or even better performance. Secondly, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the searching process for lottery jackpots. Our theoretical result suggests that the decrease in training loss during weight searching can be disturbed by the dependency between weights in modern networks. To mitigate this, we propose a novel short restriction method to restrict change of masks that may have potential negative impacts on the training loss.

Yet, these same techniques often falter when applied to the problem of recovering sparse recurrent networks. These failures are quantitative: when pruned with recent techniques, RNNs typically obtain worse performance than they do under a simple random pruning scheme. The failures are also qualitative: the distribution of active weights in a pruned LSTM or GRU network tend to be concentrated in specific neurons and gates, and not well dispersed across the entire architecture. We seek to rectify both the quantitative and qualitative issues with recurrent network pruning by introducing a new recurrent pruning objective derived from the spectrum of the recurrent Jacobian.

Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training.

Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.},

Here we show that object detectors emerge from training CNNs to perform scene classification. As scenes are composed of objects, the CNN for scene classification automatically discovers meaningful objects detectors, representative of the learned scene categories. With object detectors emerging as a result of learning to recognize scenes, our work demonstrates that the same network can perform both scene recognition and object localization in a single forward-pass, without ever having been explicitly taught the notion of objects.},

  abstract = {Numerous empirical evidence has corroborated that the noise plays a crucial rule in effective and efficient training of deep neural networks. The theory behind, however, is still largely unknown. This paper studies this fundamental problem through training a simple two-layer convolutional neural network model. Although training such a network requires to solve a non-convex optimization problem with a spurious local optimum and a global optimum, we prove that a perturbed gradient descent algorithm in conjunction with noise annealing is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum in polynomial time with arbitrary initialization. This implies that the noise enables the algorithm to efficiently escape from the spurious local optimum. Numerical experiments are provided to support our theory.},

  abstract = {Channel pruning is one of the predominant approaches for deep model compression. Existing pruning methods either train from scratch with sparsity constraints on channels, or  minimize the reconstruction error between the pre-trained feature maps and the compressed ones. Both strategies suffer from some limitations: the former kind is computationally expensive and difficult to converge, whilst the latter kind optimizes the reconstruction error but ignores the discriminative power of channels. To overcome these drawbacks, we investigate a simple-yet-effective method, called discrimination-aware channel pruning, to choose those channels that really contribute to discriminative power. To this end, we introduce additional losses into the network to increase the discriminative power of intermediate layers and then select the most discriminative channels for each layer by considering the additional loss and the reconstruction error. Last, we propose a greedy algorithm to conduct channel selection and parameter optimization in an iterative way. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For example, on ILSVRC-12, our pruned ResNet-50 with 30\% reduction of channels even outperforms the original model by 0.39\% in top-1 accuracy.},

  abstract = {Vision transformer has achieved competitive performance on a variety of computer vision applications. However, their storage, run-time memory, and computational demands are hindering the deployment to mobile devices. Here we present a vision transformer pruning approach, which identifies the impacts of dimensions in each layer of transformer and then executes pruning accordingly. By encouraging dimension-wise sparsity in the transformer, important dimensions automatically emerge. A great number of dimensions with small importance scores can be discarded to achieve a high pruning ratio without significantly compromising accuracy. The pipeline for vision transformer pruning is as follows: 1) training with sparsity regularization; 2) pruning dimensions of linear projections; 3) fine-tuning. The reduced parameters and FLOPs ratios of the proposed algorithm are well evaluated and analyzed on ImageNet dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract = {Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been deployed to solve highly non-linear and non-convex machine learning problems such as the training of deep neural networks. However, previous works on SGD often rely on restrictive and unrealistic assumptions about the nature of noise in SGD. In this work, we mathematically construct examples that defy previous understandings of SGD. For example, our constructions show that: (1) SGD may converge to a local maximum; (2) SGD may escape a saddle point arbitrarily slowly; (3) SGD may prefer sharp minima over the flat ones; and (4) AMSGrad may converge to a local maximum. We also show the relevance of our result to deep learning by presenting a minimal neural network example. Our result suggests that the noise structure of SGD might be more important than the loss landscape in neural network training and that future research should focus on deriving the actual noise structure in deep learning.},

  abstract = {The geometric structure of an optimization landscape is argued to be fundamentally important to support the success of deep neural network learning. A direct computation of the landscape beyond two layers is hard. Therefore, to capture the global view of the landscape, an interpretable model of the network-parameter (or weight) space must be established. However, the model is lacking so far. Furthermore, it remains unknown what the landscape looks like for deep networks of binary synapses, which plays a key role in robust and energy efficient neuromorphic computation. Here, we propose a statistical mechanics framework by directly building a least structured model of the high-dimensional weight space, considering realistic structured data, stochastic gradient descent training, and the computational depth of neural networks. We also consider whether the number of network parameters outnumbers the number of supplied training data, namely, over- or under-parametrization. Our least structured model reveals that the weight spaces of the under-parametrization and over-parameterization cases belong to the same class, in the sense that these weight spaces are well connected without any hierarchical clustering structure. In contrast, the shallow-network has a broken weight space, characterized by a discontinuous phase transition, thereby clarifying the benefit of depth in deep learning from the angle of high-dimensional geometry. Our effective model also reveals that inside a deep network, there exists a liquid-like central part of the architecture in the sense that the weights in this part behave as randomly as possible, providing algorithmic implications. Our data-driven model thus provides a statistical mechanics insight about why deep learning is unreasonably effective in terms of the high-dimensional weight space, and how deep networks are different from shallow ones.},
